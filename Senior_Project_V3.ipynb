       "\"Number of glucocorticoid receptors in lymphocytes and their sensitivity to hormone action . The study demonstrated a decreased level of glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) in peripheral blood lymphocytes from hypercholesterolemic subjects , and an elevated level in patients with acute myocardial infarction . In the lymphocytes with a high GR number , dexamethasone inhibited [ 3H ] - thymidine and [ 3H ] - acetate incorporation into DNA and cholesterol , respectively , in the same manner as in the control cells . On the other hand , a decreased GR number resulted in a less efficient dexamethasone inhibition of the incorporation of labeled compounds . These data showed that the sensitivity of lymphocytes to glucocorticoids changed only with a decrease of GR level . [ 1 , 25 - Dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptors in lymphocytes and T - and B - lymphocyte count in patients with glomerulonephritis ] Content of receptors to hormonal form of vitamin D3 , 1 . 25 ( OH ) 2D3 , constituted 27 . 3 fmole / mg of protein in lymphocytes of peripheric blood of children with glomerulonephritis . In the patients concentration of total and ionized form of Ca2 + was decreased down to 2 . 04 mmole / L and 1 . 09 mmole / L , respectively , while an increase in parathormone ( PTH ) by 36 % and a distinct decrease in 25 ( OH ) D concentration ( lower than 1 . 25 ng / ml ) was found in blood ; content of cAMP was also decreased in lymphocytes by 33 % . At the same time , total content of T lymphocytes was decreased 1 . 5 - fold in peripheric blood . Treatment with I - hydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 - 1 . 5 mg daily , within 4 weeks ) led to normalization of total and ionized form of Ca2 + and of 25 ( OH ) D , but did not affect the PTH content in blood . Concentration of the receptors to 1 . 25 ( OH ) 2D3 was elevated up to 39 . 7 fmole / mg after I week of the treatment , whereas it was decreased to the initial level 24 . 8 fmole / mg within 4 weeks ; simultaneous alteration in the cAMP content was observed in lymphocytes . Treatment with 1 - ( OH ) D3 normalized also the T lymphocytes content in peripheric blood . The data obtained suggest that under conditions of glomerulonephritis only high content of receptors to 1 . 25 ( OH ) 2D3 in lymphocytes enabled to perform the cell response to the hormone effect . Tumor and serum beta - 2 - microglobulin expression in women with breast cancer . To investigate whether the tumor expression of beta - 2 - microglobulin ( beta 2 - M ) could serve as a marker of tumor biologic behavior , the authors studied specimens of breast carcinomas from 60 consecutive female patients . Presence of beta 2 - M was analyzed by immunohistochemistry . No significant correlations were found between tumor beta 2 - M expression and several histologic attributes such as type , histologic and nuclear grades , mitotic index , necrosis , vascular invasion , and lymphocytic infiltration . Likewise , beta 2 - M was not associated with markers of disease extension such as TNM , ( UICC , classification of malignant tumors ) staging and axillary lymph node involvement or with estrogen , progesterone , and glucocorticoid receptor levels . However , there was a significantly positive association between tumor beta 2 - M expression and the degree of lymphocytic infiltration in the tumor tissue . Beta 2 - M serum levels were determined by an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay in samples from 22 of the above women . Although some of the highest values had been obtained in women with larger ( T4 ) primary tumors , the authors failed to detect any statistical relationship between beta 2 - M expression in the tumor with serum levels or between serum beta 2 - M and the above histologic , laboratory , and clinical factors . [ Preliminary observation of level free - form E receptor levels in serum of normal childbearing - aged and pregnant women ] In 137 cases of childbearing - aged and pregnant women , free form E receptor levels ( sE ) in serum were measured by ELISA . The level of sE was significantly decreased during the first trimester , slightly higher in the second trimester , and recovered to normal in the third trimester . The level remained lower in 29 PIH women but appeared higher in overdue pregnancies as compared with the normal 3rd trimester range . The results indicate that there is a relationship between a change in T cell function and pregnancy . Kappa B - specific DNA binding proteins : role in the regulation of human interleukin - 2 gene expression . Transcriptional activation of the human interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) gene , like induction of the IL - 2 receptor alpha ( IL - 2R alpha ) gene and the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV - 1 ) , is shown to be modulated by a kappa B - like enhancer element . Mutation of a kappa B core sequence identified in the IL - 2 promoter ( - 206 to - 195 ) partially inhibits both mitogen - and HTLV - I Tax - mediated activation of this transcription unit and blocks the specific binding of two inducible cellular factors . These kappa B - specific proteins ( 80 to 90 and 50 to 55 kilodaltons ) similarly interact with the functional kappa B enhancer present in the IL - 2R alpha promoter . These data suggest that these kappa B - specific proteins have a role in the coordinate regulation of this growth factor - growth factor receptor gene system that controls T cell proliferation . Novel region within the V kappa gene promoter is responsible for tissue and stage - specific expression of immunoglobulin genes in human lymphoid neoplasms . Immunoglobulin gene - specific transacting factors have been shown to play a role in lymphoid tissue - specific expression of immunoglobulin genes . The role of these factors in B - cell differentiation and stage - specific expression of these genes is , however , not fully understood . We have used a model of human lymphoid neoplasia to address this question . Different fragments of unrearranged human variable region of immunoglobulin kappa gene ( V kappa ) were used for cell - free in vitro transcription and DNA mobility shift assays . Previously described enhancement of in vitro transcription that was only seen with nuclear extracts derived from B - cell neoplasms corresponding to the late stages of B - cell differentiation was shown to be dependent on the actions of these factor ( s ) on the DNA region within the V kappa gene promoter . This region is located within the 920 bp fragment located 210 bp upstream from the coding region and this fragment represents a possible novel DNA region , which plays a role in the stage - and tissue - specific expression of immunoglobulin genes . [ Determination of the sensitivity to glucocorticoids in vitro ] A modified method for the determination of glucocorticoid receptors in human lymphocytes is suggested . The principal distinction of the method is standardization by the lymphocyte count in a sample ( 1 mln ) and the labeled hormone concentration . The modification saves time and money , limits the range of the data variations , and makes use of a lesser volume of blood . Examinations of 70 children aged 4 to 15 suffering from the nephrotic form of glomerulonephritis have made it possible to distinguish two groups of patients : with relatively high values of specific binding X = 6820 . 1 + / - 530 . 0 ( n = 30 , p = 0 . 95 , t = 2 . 04 ) , this corresponding to a clinical form of hormone - sensitive glomerulonephritis , and with relatively low values of specific binding X = 1815 . 2 + / - 302 . 8 ( n = 40 , p = 0 . 95 , t = 1 . 96 ) , that corresponds to hormone - resistant glomerulonephritis . Dynamic studies have not shown any statistically significant changes in the specific binding values . These results permit regarding the specific binding value as a prognostic criterion in the assessment of corticosteroid therapy ; this allows a wide employment of the described method in practical nephrology . Octamer - binding proteins from B or HeLa cells stimulate transcription of the immunoglobulin heavy - chain promoter in vitro . The B - cell - type specificity of the immunoglobulin ( Ig ) heavy - chain and light - chain promoters is mediated by an octanucleotide ( OCTA ) element , ATGCAAAT , that is also a functional component of other RNA polymerase II promoters , such as snRNA and histone H2B promoters . Two nuclear proteins that bind specifically and with high affinity to the OCTA element have been identified . NF - A1 is present in a variety of cell types , whereas the presence of NF - A2 is essentially confined to B cells , leading to the hypothesis that NF - A2 activates cell - type - specific transcription of the Ig promoter and NF - A1 mediates the other responses of the OCTA element . Extracts of the B - cell line , BJA - B , contain high levels of NF - A2 and specifically transcribe Ig promoters . In contrast , extracts from HeLa cells transcribed the Ig promoter poorly . Surprisingly , addition of either affinity - enriched NF - A2 or NF - A1 to either a HeLa extract or a partially purified reaction system specifically stimulates the Ig promoter . This suggests that the constitutive OCTA - binding factor NF - A1 can activate transcription of the Ig promoter and that B - cell - specific transcription of this promoter , at least in vitro , is partially due to a quantitative difference in the amount of OCTA - binding protein . Because NF - A1 can stimulate Ig transcription , the inability of this factor to activate in vivo the Ig promoter to the same degree as the snRNA promoters probably reflects a difference in the context of the OCTA element in these two types of promoters . Identification of a putative regulator of early T cell activation genes . Molecules involved in the antigen receptor - dependent regulation of early T cell activation genes were investigated with the use of functional sequences of the T cell activation - specific enhancer of interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) . One of these sequences forms a protein complex , NFAT - 1 , specifically with nuclear extracts of activated T cells . This complex appeared 10 to 25 minutes before the activation of the IL - 2 gene . Studies with inhibitors of protein synthesis indicated that the time of synthesis of the activator of the IL - 2 gene in Jurkat T cells corresponds to the time of appearance of NFAT - 1 . NFAT - 1 , or a very similar protein , bound functional sequences of the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ; the LTR of this virus is known to be stimulated during early T cell activation . The binding site for this complex activated a linked promoter after transfection into antigen receptor - activated T cells but not other cell types . These characteristics suggest that NFAT - 1 transmits signals initiated at the T cell antigen receptor . Characterization of thyroid hormone receptors in human IM - 9 lymphocytes . Although putatively identified more than 10 years ago , thyroid hormone receptors in human tissues remain poorly characterized . As a first step towards understanding the mechanism of thyroid hormone action in man we have characterized T3 binding sites in nuclei of the human lymphoblastoid line , IM - 9 cells . In whole cell experiments at 37 degrees C , nuclear binding of [ 125I ] T3 was saturable ( Kd 34 + / - 6 pmol / l ) and of finite capacity ( approximately equal to 350 sites / cell ) . The binding sites were extracted from a nuclear pellet by treatment with 0 . 4 mol / l KCl and sonication . Separation of bound from free [ 125I ] T3 in the extracts was achieved using the calcium phosphate matrix , hydroxyapatite at a concentration of 0 . 3 ml of a 150 g / l slurry . Rectilinear Scatchard plots were obtained only when the hydroxyapatite was washed with a buffer containing 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 . Under these conditions T3 binding sites in the nuclear extracts were present at a concentration of 22 . 4 + / - 8 . 6 fmol / mg protein and showed an affinity of ( Kd , room temperature ) 140 + / - 10 pmol / l . The same assay system was used to determine the hierarchy of affinities for a range of natural and synthetic analogues . Calling T3 100 , the order of potencies observed was : Triac , 500 ; 3 , 5 - diiodo - 3 ' - isopropylthyronine , 89 ; T4 , 32 ; 3 , 5 - dimethyl - 3 ' isopropylthyronine 2 ; 3 , 5 - T2 , 0 . 7 , rT3 , 0 . 4 ; 3 ' 5 ' - T2 , less than 0 . 01 . These results suggest that the T3 binding sites present in human IM - 9 lymphocyte nuclei and extracts thereof are thyroid hormone receptors . These cells may be a useful tool to increase our understanding of human T3 receptors Definition of T - cell specific DNA - binding factors that interact with a 3 ' - silencer in the CD4 + T - cell gene Rpt - 1 . Analysis of the region 3 ' to the CD4 + T - cell gene Rpt - 1 ( encoding regulatory protein T - lymphocyte 1 ) led to the definition of a silencer element that inhibits heterologous gene expression in certain CD4 + T - cell lines but not in B - cell or non - lymphoid cell lines . Functional silencer activity in vivo was associated with the presence of a specific silencer - DNA - protein complex in electrophoretic mobility shift assays with T - cell extracts . Formation of this complex was selectively inhibited by the region in HIV - 1 containing a silencer element . We discuss the possibility that DNA - binding factors may coregulate HIV - 1 and Rpt - 1 gene expression through a common transcriptional silencer element . Congenital immunodeficiencies associated with absence of HLA class II antigens on lymphocytes result from distinct mutations in trans - acting factors . Coordinate regulation of HLA class II gene expression during development and coinduction of class II genes by soluble factors suggests that common trans - acting factor ( s ) control expression of these genes . In B - lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from two independent class II - deficient bare lymphocyte syndrome patients , we observed a drastic decrease in transcription rates of the class II genes . When these cell lines are fused , class II genes are reexpressed , indicating that immunodeficiencies in bare lymphocyte syndrome patients are the result of two distinct mutations . Further studies show that genes governing the expression of class II antigens fall into at least three complementation groups ; two of these were previously unidentified in mutant cell lines generated in vitro . In addition , we report the identification of two discrete complexes , NFX1 . 1 and NFX1 . 2 , that bind to the DRA X consensus element . Though the mutation in at least one mutant line generated in vitro ( RJ2 . 2 . 5 ) affects products functioning via interaction with the X box , clear alterations in either NFX1 . 1 or NFX1 . 2 are not found in any of the mutant cell lines . In vivo responsiveness to glucocorticoid correlated with glucocorticoid receptor content in peripheral blood leukocytes in normal humans . Dexamethasone loading tests ( 0 . 1 mg dexamethasone / kg , iv ) were performed in 18 normal males to evaluate the individual responsiveness to glucocorticoid . There were inter - individual differences in increase in peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocyte count , decrease in peripheral blood lymphocyte count , and increase in plasma free fatty acids levels after dexamethasone injection . In addition , there was a significant correlation between the maximum increase in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and the maximum decrease in lymphocytes ( r = 0 . 7514 , p less than 0 . 0003 ) . Simultaneous measurements of glucocorticoid receptor content by whole - cell assay revealed that glucocorticoid receptor content in polymorphonuclear leukocytes linearly correlated with that in the corresponding lymphocytes ( r = 0 . 9482 , p less than 0 . 0001 ) . There were also significant correlations between the maximum increase in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and glucocorticoid receptor content in polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( r = 0 . 7239 , p less than 0 . 0007 ) , and between the maximum decrease in lymphocytes and glucocorticoid receptor content in lymphocytes ( r = 0 . 7703 , p less than 0 . 0002 ) . These results suggest that individual differences are preserved both in glucocorticoid responsiveness and in glucocorticoid receptor content in peripheral blood leukocytes in normal humans . Estradiol receptors in the cytosol of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in hepatitis B virus carriers treated with interferon - alpha . Estradiol receptors in the cytosol of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the effects of interferon - alpha ( IFN - alpha ) on estradiol receptors were studied in asymptomatic hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) carriers , patients with chronic hepatitis B and normal controls . The level of estradiol receptors in the cytosol of mononuclear cells was significantly lower in asymptomatic HBV carriers and patients with chronic hepatitis B , compared to normal controls . This low level of cytosol estradiol receptors in patients with chronic hepatitis B was increased by the administration of IFN - alpha . In addition , when peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with chronic hepatitis B were incubated with IFN - alpha in vitro , the level of cytosol estradiol receptors also increased by increasing the concentration of IFN - alpha . We previously reported that the response of mononuclear cells to estrogen is impaired in HBV carriers , and our present results suggested that this may be due to the low level of estradiol receptors in the cytosol of mononuclear cells . Association of increased lytic effector cell function with high estrogen receptor levels in tumor - bearing patients with breast cancer . Tumor - bearing patients with breast cancer were assayed for their natural killer ( NK ) cell activity and for the function of activated cytotoxic T - cells , as assessed by lectin - dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( LDCC ) . Tumor - bearing patients with breast cancer had a significant increase in NK activity and in LDCC , as compared with healthy control individuals . Although the enhanced NK cell activity and LDCC were closely associated with high levels ( greater than 31 fmol / mg ) of estrogen receptor ( ER ) content in the primary tumor , no other clinical or histologic correlation between the increase in either parameter of cytotoxic effector cell function could be found . Thus , ER levels greater than 31 fmol / mg might be associated with increased cytotoxic effector cell function in tumor - bearing patients with breast cancer . Properties of glucocorticoid receptors in Epstein - Barr virus - transformed lymphocytes from patients with familial cortisol resistance . In a previous report of two patients with familial glucocorticoid resistance due to reduced numbers of glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) , we have shown decreased numbers of GR in peripheral mononuclear cells and cultured fibroblasts but normal affinity of GR in both patients . In this study , peripheral lymphocytes from these patients , one patient ' s son and daughter , and normal subjects were transformed with Epstein - Barr virus . Reduced numbers and normal affinity of GR were found in the Epstein - Barr virus - transformed lymphocytes from both patients while the son and daughter had normal numbers and affinity of GR . The thermal stability of GR and thermal activation of cytosolic receptors in both patients were found to be normal . Although the percentages of nuclear bound GR were similar in both patients and normal controls , the absolute amounts of nuclear bound GR of the patients were about one - half that of normal controls . These abnormal properties of GR ( reduced numbers of GR ) were preserved in the transformed cells from the patients . Octamer transcription factors 1 and 2 each bind to two different functional elements in the immunoglobulin heavy - chain promoter . Immunoglobulin heavy - chain genes contain two conserved sequence elements 5 ' to the site of transcription initiation : the octamer ATGCAAAT and the heptamer CTCATGA . Both of these elements are required for normal cell - specific promoter function . The present study demonstrates that both the ubiquitous and lymphoid - cell - specific octamer transcription factors ( OTF - 1 and OTF - 2 , respectively ) interact specifically with each of the two conserved sequence elements , forming either homo - or heterodimeric complexes . This was surprising , since the heptamer and octamer sequence motifs bear no obvious similarity to each other . Binding of either factor to the octamer element occurred independently . However , OTF interaction with the heptamer sequence appeared to require the presence of an intact octamer motif and occurred with a spacing of either 2 or 14 base pairs between the two elements , suggesting coordinate binding resulting from protein - protein interactions . The degeneracy in sequences recognized by the OTFs may be important in widening the range over which gene expression can be modulated and in establishing cell type specificity . Identification of a novel lymphoid specific octamer binding protein ( OTF - 2B ) by proteolytic clipping bandshift assay ( PCBA ) . The octamer sequence ATGCAAAT is found in the promoters of immunoglobulin ( Ig ) heavy and light chain genes and in the heavy chain enhancer and is a major determinant of the cell type specific expression of Ig genes in B cells . An apparent paradox is that the same sequence serves as an upstream promoter or enhancer element in a variety of housekeeping genes such as the histone H2B and U snRNA genes . The differential usage of this regulatory sequence motif is thought to be mediated by different species of octamer binding proteins . One species of 100 kd , designated OTF - 1 , is present in all cell types and may exert its activating function only when it can interact with additional adjacent transcription factors . The lymphoid cell specific octamer binding protein of 60 kd ( OTF - 2A ) specifically stimulates Ig promoters which consist essentially of a TATA - box and an octamer sequence upstream of it . Here we present evidence for yet another B cell specific octamer binding protein of 75 kd ( OTF - 2B ) . From several findings , including the absence of OTF - 2B ( but not OTF - 2A ) from a lymphocyte line that can not respond to the IgH enhancer , we propose a role of the novel octamer factor in the long range activation by the IgH enhancer . We have used the proteolytic clipping bandshift assay ( PCBA ) technique to distinguish the three different forms found in B cells . This analysis indicates that the 75 kd - species OTF - 2B is closely related to the 60 kd species OTF - 2A . Inhibition of interleukin 2 - induced proliferation of cloned murine T cells by glucocorticoids . Possible involvement of an inhibitory protein . The ability of glucocorticoids to inhibit interleukin 2 ( IL 2 ) - induced T cell proliferation in two cytotoxic T cell ( CTL ) clones has been studied . A complete inhibition of DNA synthesis by dexamethasone ( Dx ) could be observed when IL 2 - depleted cultures of CTL were either incubated for 6 h with the hormone prior to the addition of IL 2 or treated simultaneously with Dx and a low concentration of IL 2 . No significant reduction in the number and affinity of IL 2 receptors was seen after 6 h incubation with Dx . The order of potency observed with the different steroids indicated that this inhibitory effect was mediated through binding to a specific glucocorticoid receptor . The action of these hormones possibly involves the synthesis of an inhibitory protein ( s ) , since the presence of cycloheximide during the incubation with Dx prevented the inhibition of DNA synthesis . Furthermore , supernatant from Dx - treated CTL contained a nondialyzable factor which inhibited DNA synthesis and cell growth of CTL clones induced by IL 2 . Blocking of IL 2 synthesis and IL 2 receptor formation have been proposed as one of the major mechanisms of glucocorticoid - induced immunosuppression . Our results indicate that these hormones may also affect T cell proliferation by inhibiting IL 2 activity . Identification and purification of a human immunoglobulin - enhancer - binding protein ( NF - kappa B ) that activates transcription from a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 promoter in vitro . The enhancer - binding factor NF - kappa B , which is found only in cells that transcribe immunoglobulin light chain genes , has been purified from nuclear extracts of Namalwa cells ( human Burkitt lymphoma cells ) by sequence - specific DNA affinity chromatography . The purified NF - kappa B has been identified as a 51 - kDa polypeptide by UV - crosslinking analysis . ` ` Footprint ' ' and methylation - interference analyses have shown that purified NF - kappa B has a binding activity specific for the kappa light chain enhancer sequence . The purified factor activated in vitro transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus type I promoter by binding to an upstream NF - kappa B - binding site Lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptor binding in depression : normal values following recovery . The number of glucocorticoid receptor sites in lymphocytes and plasma cortisol concentrations were measured in 20 patients who had recovered from major depressive disorder and 20 healthy control subjects . The number of glucocorticoid receptor sites in lymphocytes from the recovered depressed group was not significantly different from that of the control group . Although the mean plasma cortisol concentration in recovered depressives was higher than in control subjects , the difference only just reached significance . This study shows that the reduction in glucocorticoid receptor numbers which occurs during acute depressive illness does not persist on recovery and is , therefore , state - dependent . Identification and purification of a human lymphoid - specific octamer - binding protein ( OTF - 2 ) that activates transcription of an immunoglobulin promoter in vitro . The octamer sequence 5 ' - ATGCAAAT , in either orientation , serves as an upstream element in a variety of promoters and also occurs as a modular enhancer element . It is of particular interest in immunoglobulin genes since it is found in the upstream regions of all heavy and light chain promoters and in the heavy chain enhancer , both of which are known to be necessary for cell - specific expression . We report here the chromatographic separation of ubiquitous and B cell - specific octamer - binding proteins . The B cell factor was purified to homogeneity using affinity chromatography and consists of three peptides of 62 , 61 , and 58 . 5 + / - 1 . 5 kd . Each of the polypeptides was renatured after SDS - PAGE and shown to bind to the octamer sequence . The specific DNA binding activity of the pure B cell - specific factor was indistinguishable from that of the affinity - purified ubiquitous factor . This B cell - specific octamer - binding factor , in pure form , activated transcription from a kappa light chain promoter in vitro , thus demonstrating that it is indeed a B cell - specific transcription factor for this gene . In addition to the ubiquitous and B cell - specific octamer - binding factors , we identified several additional proteins , one of which is B cell - specific , that interact with the kappa promoter . Decreased deoxyribonucleic acid binding of glucocorticoid - receptor complex in cultured skin fibroblasts from a patient with the glucocorticoid resistance syndrome . A patient with the syndrome of glucocorticoid resistance was studied . A 27 - yr - old woman initially was diagnosed as having Cushing ' s disease , based on the findings of high plasma ACTH and serum cortisol levels , increased urinary cortisol secretion , resistance to adrenal suppression with dexamethasone , and bilateral adrenal hyperplasia by computed tomography and scintigraphy of the adrenal glands . However , she had no signs or symptoms of Cushing ' s syndrome . During a 5 - yr follow - up , no clinical abnormalities developed , although hypercortisolism persisted . End - organ resistance to cortisol was suspected . To explain the end - organ resistance to cortisol , the glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) in peripheral mononuclear leukocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts from a forearm skin biopsy were characterized and compared with the results of similar studies in normal subjects . The patient ' s GR in whole cell assays had an increased dissociation constant ( Kd ) . In the cytosol of cultured skin fibroblasts from the patient , there was also decreased binding capacity . The thermal stability and the sedimentation coefficient in a sucrose density gradient of the receptors in the cytosol of cultured skin fibroblasts from the patient and normal subjects were similar . GR complex activation , analyzed by DEAE - cellulose chromatography , was decreased in the patient . DNA binding of the GR complex after temperature - induced activation was lower in the patient than in normal subjects . Nuclear translocation of GR complexes from the patient was also slightly decreased . These results suggest that the patient ' s glucocorticoid resistance was due to a decrease in the affinity of the receptor for glucocorticoids and a decrease in the binding of the GR complex to DNA . Granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor . Sensitive and receptor - mediated regulation by 1 , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 in normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes . We show that 1 , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 , 25 [ OH ] 2D3 ) , the most hormonally active metabolite of vitamin D3 , modulates sensitively and specifically both the protein and messenger RNA accumulation of the multilineage growth factor granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) . The regulation of GM - CSF expression is seen in both normal human mitogen - activated T lymphocytes and T lymphocytes from a line ( S - LB1 ) transformed with human T cell lymphotropic virus 1 ( HTLV - 1 ) . In contrast , cells from a HTLV - 1 transformed T lymphocyte line ( Ab - VDR ) established from a patient with vitamin D - resistant rickets type II with undetectable 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 cellular receptors are resistant to the action of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 . Inhibition of GM - CSF expression by 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 can occur independently of interleukin 2 regulation and is probably mediated through cellular 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 receptors . We conclude that 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 may be important in the physiology of hematopoiesis . Altered interaction between triiodothyronine and its nuclear receptors in absence of cortisol : a proposed mechanism for increased thyrotropin secretion in corticosteroid deficiency states . Thyroid hormones occasionally appear less effective when administered alone to patients with panhypopituitarism , and manifestations suggestive of hypothyroidism have been reported in patients suffering from untreated Addison ' s disease . In the latter condition , thyrotropin secretion is increased : this occurs already after as little as 2 days of temporary withdrawal of therapy with substitution doses of corticosteroids while circulating levels of thyroid hormones remain within normal limits . Therefore , a possible role of cortisol in interaction between triiodothyronine and its nuclear receptors was examined at the level of circulating lymphocytes obtained from patients with primary or secondary adrenocortical failure . The affinity of these receptors was found to be decreased , by more than 50 % on average , in the absence of cortisol treatments . This change was promptly corrected upon resumption of therapy . The number of binding sites was not significantly modified . The influence of cortisol on thyroid hormone receptors discussed here might account for the clinical observations mentioned above . Inhibition by cortisol of human natural killer ( NK ) cell activity . The effects of cortisol on the natural killer ( NK ) activity of human peripheral blood mononuclear ( PBM ) cells were studied in vitro using a direct 4 - h 51Cr - release assay and K 562 cell line as a target . Preincubation for 20 h of PBM cells drawn from healthy donors with 1 X 10 ( - 8 ) to 1 X 10 ( - 5 ) M cortisol resulted in a significant decrease of NK cell activity . The magnitude of the suppression was directly related to the steroid concentration and inversely related to the number of effector cells . Cortisol was able to minimize the enhancement of NK cytotoxicity obtainable in the presence of immune interferon ( IFN - gamma ) . A significantly higher suppression was achieved after sequential exposure of PBM cells to cortisol and equimolar levels of prostaglandin E2 ( PgE2 ) . The concomitant incubation with theophylline and isobutyl - methylxanthine failed to enhance the cortisol - induced suppression , whereas PgE2 - dependent inhibition significantly increased after exposure of PBM cells to methyl - xanthines . The inhibitory effect of cortisol was partially or totally prevented by the concomitant incubation with equimolar amounts of 11 - deoxycortisol and RU 486 but not of progesterone . Treatment of NK effectors with a monoclonal anti - human corticosteroid - binding globulin ( CBG ) antibody produced an enhancement of the spontaneous NK activity and a partial suppression of cortisol - mediated effects . Our results suggest that endogenous glucocorticoids play a role in the regulation of NK cell - mediated cytotoxicity . Since the effect of cortisol was additive to that of PgE2 and was not changed by phosphodiesterase inhibitors , it is conceivable that the hormone acts at a level different from the adenylate cyclase - phosphodiesterase system . Data obtained with the use of antiglucocorticoids and the anti - CBG antibody are compatible with a role both of high - affinity glucocorticoid receptors and of CBG in mediating cortisol action on the human NK cell activity . Interaction of cell - type - specific nuclear proteins with immunoglobulin VH promoter region sequences . All human and murine immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region ( VH ) genes contain the sequence ATGCAAAT approximately 70 nucleotides 5 ' from the site of transcription initiation . This octanucleotide , in reverse orientation , is also found in all light chain variable region ( VL ) genes , and in the immunoglobulin heavy chain transcriptional enhancer . Transfection studies have established that this octamer is involved in the lymphoid - specific transcription of immunoglobulin genes . Octamer - containing fragments have been reported to bind a factor present in nuclear extracts of human cell lines ; however , identical binding activity was detected in both B lymphoid and non - lymphoid cells . Here we establish that nuclear extracts from distinct cell types differ in their ability to interact with octamer - containing fragments . We have also detected a DNA - protein interaction that may be involved in the cell - type specificity of immunoglobulin expression , and we have determined that a sequence upstream of the octamer participates in an interaction with a nuclear protein ( s ) . Preferential transcription of HTLV - I LTR in cell - free extracts of human T cells producing HTLV - I viral proteins . The promoters of the adenovirus 2 major late gene , the mouse beta - globin gene , the mouse immunoglobulin VH gene and the LTR of the human T - lymphotropic retrovirus type I were tested for their transcription activities in cell - free extracts of four cell lines ; HeLa , CESS ( Epstein - Barr virus - transformed human B cell line ) , MT - 1 ( HTLV - I - infected human T cell line without viral protein synthesis ) , and MT - 2 ( HTLV - I - infected human T cell line producing viral proteins ) . LTR was preferentially transcribed in the extracts of MT - 2 although the other three genes were transcribed with relatively constant efficiencies in different extracts . The results agree well with the previous in vivo studies on the promoter activity of HTLV - I LTR . Mixing of HeLa and MT - 2 extracts revealed the presence of a LTR - specific stimulating activity in MT - 2 extracts . A nuclear factor that binds to a conserved sequence motif in transcriptional control elements of immunoglobulin genes . Trans - acting factors that mediate B - cell specific transcription of immunoglobulin genes have been postulated based on an analysis of the expression of exogenously introduced immunoglobulin gene recombinants in lymphoid and non - lymphoid cells . Two B - cell - specific , cis - acting transcriptional regulatory elements have been identified . One element is located in the intron between the variable ( V ) and constant ( C ) regions of both heavy and kappa light - chain genes and acts as a transcriptional enhancer . The second element is found upstream of both heavy and kappa light - chain gene promoters . This element directs lymphoid - specific transcription even in the presence of viral enhancers . We have sought nuclear factors that might bind specifically to these two regulatory elements by application of a modified gel electrophoresis DNA binding assay . We report here the identification of a human B - cell nuclear factor ( IgNF - A ) that binds to DNA sequences in the upstream regions of both the mouse heavy and kappa light - chain gene promoters and also to the mouse heavy - chain gene enhancer . This sequence - specific binding is probably mediated by a highly conserved sequence motif , ATTTGCAT , present in all three transcriptional elements . Interestingly , a factor showing similar binding specificity to IgNF - A is also present in human HeLa cells . The new world primates as animal models of glucocorticoid resistance . Many New World primate species have greatly increased plasma cortisol concentrations , decreased plasma cortisol binding globulin capacity and affinity , marked resistance of the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal axis to suppression by dexamethasone , and no biological evidence of glucocorticoid excess . These primates also have high levels of circulating progesterone , estrogen , mineralocorticoid , androgen and vitamin D . The glucocorticoid target tissues that have been examined ( circulating mononuclear lymphocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts ) have normal concentrations of glucocorticoid receptors with decreased affinity for dexamethasone . Transformation of B - lymphocytes with the Epstein - Barr virus leads to glucocorticoid receptor induction that is less than that observed with cells from Old World primates . The receptor in these cells has a low affinity for dexamethasone . The low affinity leads to an increased loss of specific bound ligand during thermal activation . Meroreceptor generation is normal . The molecular weight of the receptor , determined by SDS - PAGE , is similar to that of Old World primates ( approximately 92 , 000 ) and the activation pattern per se , examined in vitro by heating cytosol and performing phosphocellulose chromatography , appears similar to that of human controls . The ratios of nuclear to cytosolic hormone - receptor - complexes and of cytosolic activated to unactivated receptor complexes in intact cells are similar to Old World primates . Results from mixing studies do not support the hypothesis that a binding inhibitor ( s ) or a deficient cytosolic positive modifier ( s ) of binding underlies the findings in these primates . The New World primates , unlike men with the syndrome of primary cortisol resistance , have compensated for their condition with intra - adrenal and mineralocorticoid receptor adaptations . Thus , unlike Old World primates , cortisol in New World primates has only weak sodium - retaining potency because the aldosterone receptor has a low affinity for cortisol . The common element that would explain the apparent resistance to six steroid hormones in New World primates Acetylation and modulation of erythroid Kruppel - like factor ( EKLF ) activity by interaction with histone acetyltransferases . Erythroid Kruppel - like factor ( EKLF ) is a red cell - specific transcriptional activator that is crucial for consolidating the switch to high levels of adult beta - globin expression during erythroid ontogeny . EKLF is required for integrity of the chromatin structure at the beta - like globin locus , and it interacts with a positive - acting factor in vivo . We find that EKLF is an acetylated transcription factor , and that it interacts in vivo with CBP , p300 , and P / CAF . However , its interactions with these histone acetyltransferases are not equivalent , as CBP and p300 , but not P / CAF , utilize EKLF as a substrate for in vitro acetylation within its trans - activation region . The functional effects of these interactions are that CBP and p300 , but not P / CAF , enhance EKLF ' s transcriptional activation of the beta - globin promoter in erythroid cells . These results establish EKLF as a tissue - specific transcription factor that undergoes post - translational acetylation and suggest a mechanism by which EKLF is able to alter chromatin structure and induce beta - globin expression within the beta - like globin cluster . Recognition of herpes simplex virus type 2 tegument proteins by CD4 T cells infiltrating human genital herpes lesions . The local cellular immune response to herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) is important in the control of recurrent HSV infection . The antiviral functions of infiltrating CD4 - bearing T cells may include cytotoxicity , inhibition of viral growth , lymphokine secretion , and support of humoral and CD8 responses . The antigens recognized by many HSV - specific CD4 T cells localizing to genital HSV - 2 lesions are unknown . T cells recognizing antigens encoded within map units 0 . 67 to 0 . 73 of HSV DNA are frequently recovered from herpetic lesions . Expression cloning with this region of DNA now shows that tegument protein VP22 and the viral dUTPase , encoded by genes UL49 and UL50 , respectively , are T - cell antigens . Separate epitopes in VP22 were defined for T - cell clones from each of three patients . Reactivity with the tegument protein encoded by UL21 was identified for an additional patient . Three new epitopes were identified in VP16 , a tegument protein associated with VP22 . Some tegument - specific CD4 T - cell clones exhibited cytotoxic activity against HSV - infected cells . These results suggest that herpes simplex tegument proteins are processed for antigen presentation in vivo and are possible candidate compounds for herpes simplex vaccines . Fibrinogen activates NF - kappa B transcription factors in mononuclear phagocytes . Adhesion to extracellular matrices is known to modulate leukocyte activation , although the mechanisms are not fully understood . Mononuclear phagocytes are exposed to fibrinous provisional matrix throughout migration into inflammatory foci , so this study was undertaken to determine whether fibrinogen triggers activation of NF - kappa B transcription factors . U937 cells differentiated with PMA in nonadherent culture were shown to express two fibrinogen - binding integrins , predominately CD11b / CD18 , and to a lesser extent , CD11c / CD18 . Cells stimulated with fibrinogen ( 10 - 100 microg / ml ) / Mn2 + ( 50 microM ) for 2 h were examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay . NF - kappa B activation , minimal in unstimulated cells , was substantially up - regulated by fibrinogen . Fibrinogen also caused activation of AP - 1 , but not SP1 or cAMP response element - binding protein ( CREB ) factors . Blocking mAbs against CD18 and CD11b abrogated fibrinogen - induced NF - kappa B activation . To determine the effects on transcriptional regulation , U937 cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the HIV - 1 enhancer ( bearing two NF - kappa B sites ) coupled to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter . Cells were subsequently stimulated with 1 ) PMA for 24 h , inducing CAT activity by 2 . 6 - fold , 2 ) fibrinogen / Mn2 + for 2 h , inducing CAT activity by 3 . 2 - fold , or 3 ) costimulation with fibrinogen and PMA , inducing 5 . 7 - fold the CAT activity induced by PMA alone . We conclude that contact with fibrinogen - derived proteins may contribute to mononuclear phagocyte activation by signaling through CD11b / CD18 , resulting in selective activation of transcriptional regulatory factors , including NF - kappa B . Peripheral blood T cells and monocytes and B cell lines derived from patients with lupus express estrogen receptor transcripts similar to those of normal cells . OBJECTIVE : To identify and characterize estrogen receptor ( ER ) transcripts expressed in immune cells of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) and healthy donors . METHODS : Peripheral blood monocytes and T cells were prepared from patients with SLE ( n = 6 ) and healthy donors ( n = 8 ) . T cells were separated into CD4 and CD8 . Some monocytes and T cells were stimulated with estradiol , PMA , and ionomycin . Epstein - Barr virus - transformed B cell lines ( n = 7 ) and B cell hybridomas ( n = 2 ) established from patients with SLE and a healthy individual were used as a B cell source . These cells were examined for ER mRNA by reverse transcription nested polymerase chain reaction . Amplified cDNA were sequenced by standard methods . RESULTS : In all cells tested , ER mRNA was expressed without prior in vitro stimulation . Partial sequences from exons 1 - 8 were nearly identical to the published sequence of the human ER mRNA . There were no notable differences in the ER transcripts between patients and healthy controls . Variant receptor transcripts lacking exon 5 or exon 7 , which encodes the hormone binding domain , were identified in the majority of the cells . Precise deletion of the exons suggests that they are alternatively spliced transcripts . Whether the detected transcripts are translated into functional receptor proteins remains to be determined . In vitro stimulation did not affect ER mRNA expression . The presence of variants did not correlate with disease activity or medication . CONCLUSION : Monocytes , T cells , and B cells in patients express transcripts of the normal wild type ER and the hormone binding domain variants in vivo . DNA damaging agents induce expression of Fas ligand and subsequent apoptosis in T lymphocytes via the activation of NF - kappa B and AP - 1 . Apoptosis induced by DNA damage and other stresses can proceed via expression of Fas ligand ( FasL ) and ligation of its receptor , Fas ( CD95 ) . We report that activation of the two transcription factors NF - kappa B and AP - 1 is crucially involved in FasL expression induced by etoposide , teniposide , and UV irradiation . A nondegradable mutant of I kappa B blocked both FasL expression and apoptosis induced by DNA damage but not Fas ligation . These stimuli also induced the stress - activated kinase pathway ( SAPK / JNK ) , which was required for the maximal induction of apoptosis . A 1 . 2 kb FasL promoter responded to DNA damage , as well as coexpression with p65 Rel or Fos / Jun . Mutations in the relevant NF - kappa B and AP - 1 binding sites eliminated these responses . Thus , activation of NF - kappa B and AP - 1 contributes to stress - induced apoptosis via the expression of FasL . A small , nonpeptidyl mimic of granulocyte - colony - stimulating factor [ see commetns ] A nonpeptidyl small molecule SB 247464 , capable of activating granulocyte - colony - stimulating factor ( G - CSF ) signal transduction pathways , was identified in a high - throughput assay in cultured cells . Like G - CSF , SB 247464 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple signaling proteins and stimulated primary murine bone marrow cells to form granulocytic colonies in vitro . It also elevated peripheral blood neutrophil counts in mice . The extracellular domain of the murine G - CSF receptor was required for the activity of SB 247464 , suggesting that the compound acts by oligomerizing receptor chains . The results indicate that a small molecule can activate a receptor that normally binds a relatively large protein ligand . Minimal residual disease in acute myelogenous leukemia with PML / RAR alpha or AML1 / ETO mRNA and phenotypic analysis of possible T and natural killer cells in bone marrow . Here we studied minimal residual disease ( MRD ) of patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) who have PML / RAR alpha or AML1 / ETO as well as the phenotypic analysis of lymphocyte subsets involved in antitumor immunity . Eight patients in long - term ( LT ; 3 to 15 years ) and 15 patients in short - term ( ST ; up to 3 years ) remission were studied . Using the reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( RT ) assay , the limit of detection was 10 ( - 5 ) to 10 ( - 6 ) for PML / RAR alpha transcript and 10 ( - 4 ) to 10 ( - 5 ) for the AML1 / ETO transcript . Simultaneously , T lymphocyte subsets and NK cells from the peripheral blood ( PB ) and bone marrow ( BM ) were investigated by flow cytometric analysis . Four of the eight patients in LT and 7 of the 15 patients in ST remission were MRD - positive . Although all MRD - positive patients in LT remission are still until now event - free , 3 of the 7 MRD - positive ( MRD + ) patients in ST remission soon relapsed . The total populations of CD4 + , CD8 + and CD56 + [ possible T - cell and natural killer ( T / NK ) populations ] in the BM of ST patients and MRD + / LT patients were significantly ( p < . 01 ) low . The CD8 + CD28 + population showed the same tendency ( p < . 01 - . 02 ) . The T / NK subsets in the BM of MRD - negative ( MRD - ) LT ( MRD - / LT ) patients showed similar numbers of cells as normal volunteers . Basically , the total percentage of the CD4 + , CD8 + and CD56 + cell populations in the BM was increased and in the following order : MRD - / LT patients , normal volunteers , MRD + / LT patients and MRD + or - / ST patients . The percentages of the T / NK - cell subsets in the PB were not significantly different among these groups . Thus , the difference of the possible T / NK - cell phenotype in the BM may strongly influence clinical and molecular remission . These results still remain to be confirmed by further studies of the functional anti - tumor immunity of T / NK cells of AML in remission . Mycobacterium tuberculosis mannose - capped lipoarabinomannan can induce NF - kappaB - dependent activation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat in T cells . Tuberculosis has emerged as an epidemic , extended by the large number of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) . The major goal of this study was to determine whether the mycobacterial cell wall component mannose - capped lipoarabinomannan ( ManLAM ) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M . tuberculosis ) could activate transcription of HIV - 1 in T cells with the use of an in vitro cell culture system . These experiments are of prime importance considering that CD4 - expressing T lymphocytes represent the major virus reservoir in the peripheral blood of infected individuals . Using the 1G5 cell line harbouring the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the HIV - 1 LTR , it was first found that culture protein filtrates ( CFP ) from M . tuberculosis or purified ManLAM could activate HIV - 1 LTR - dependent gene expression unlike similarly prepared CFP extracts devoid of ManLAM . The implication of protein tyrosine kinase ( s ) , protein kinase A and / or protein kinase C was highlighted by the abrogation of the ManLAM - mediated activation of HIV - 1 LTR - driven gene expression using herbimycin A and H7 . It was also determined , using electrophoresis mobility shift assays , that M . tuberculosis ManLAM led to the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF - kappaB . M . tuberculosis ManLAM resulted in clear induction of the luciferase gene placed under the control of the wild - type , but not the kappaB - mutated , HIV - 1 LTR region . Finally , the ManLAM - mediated activation of HIV - 1 LTR transcription was found to be independent of the autocrine or paracrine action of endogenous TNF - alpha . The results suggest that M . tuberculosis can upregulate HIV - 1 expression in T cells and could thus have the potential to influence the pathogenesis of HIV - 1 infection . Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat quasispecies differ in basal transcription and nuclear factor recruitment in human glial cells and lymphocytes . The generation of genomic diversity during the course of infection has the potential to affect all aspects of HIV - 1 replication , including expression of the proviral genome . To gain a better understanding of the impact of long terminal repeat ( LTR ) sequence diversity on LTR - directed gene expression in cells of the central nervous system ( CNS ) and immune system , we amplified and cloned LTRs from proviral DNA in HIV - 1 - infected peripheral blood . Sequence analysis of nineteen LTRs cloned from 2 adult and 3 pediatric patients revealed an average of 33 nucleotide changes ( with respect to the sequence of the LAI LTR ) within the 455 - bp U3 region . Transient expression analyses in cells of neuroglial and lymphocytic origin demonstrated that some of these LTRs had activities which varied significantly from the LAI LTR in U - 373 MG cells ( an astrocytoma cell line ) as well as in Jurkat cells ( a CD4 - positive lymphocyte cell line ) . While LTRs which demonstrated the highest activities in U - 373 MG cells also yielded high activities in Jurkat cells , the LTRs were generally more active in Jurkat cells when compared to the LAI LTR . Differences in LTR sequence also resulted in differences in transcription factor recruitment to cis - acting sites within the U3 region of the LTR , as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays . In particular , naturally occurring sequence variation impacted transcription factor binding to an activating transcription factor / cAMP response element binding ( ATF / CREB ) binding site ( located between the LEF - 1 and distal NF - kappaB transcription factor binding sites ) that we identified in previous studies of the HIV - 1 LTR . These findings suggest that LTR sequence changes can significantly affect basal LTR function and transcription factor recruitment , which may , in turn , alter the course of viral replication in cells of CNS and immune system origin . HMG box containing transcription factors in lymphocyte differentiation . The identification of the mammalian sex - determining gene Sry has led to the discovery of a large family of related ( ' HMG box ' ) transcription factors that control developmental events in yeast , C . elegans , Drosophila and vertebrates . In lymphocyte differentiation , several HMG box proteins play a decisive role . Sox - 4 is important for very early B - cell differentiation , while TCF - 1 / LEF - 1 play a crucial role in early thymocyte development . TCF / LEF proteins have recently been found to constitute a downstream component of the Wingless / Wnt signal transduction pathway . In flies , this pathway controls segment polarity ; in Xenopus it controls the definition of the body axis . Deregulation of the pathway occurs in several human tumors . These insights in the molecular events that are involved in TCF / LEF function in these organisms may eventually lead to the understanding of the function of these HMG box proteins in lymphoid development Transcriptional regulation by C / EBP alpha and - beta in the expression of the gene for the MRP14 myeloid calcium binding protein . Transcriptional regulation of the gene for the myeloid calcium binding protein , MRP14 , was investigated in human monocytic leukemia cell lines . The MRP14 gene was not expressed in monoblastic ML - 1 cells , promonocytic U - 937 cells , or promyelocytic HL - 60 cells . On the other hand , the gene was expressed in monocytic THP - 1 cells and in the HL - 60 cells treated with 1 , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( VD3 ) . The level of MRP14 in VD3 - treated HL - 60 cells was two - fold higher than that in THP - 1 cells . Among several known transcription factor binding motifs , nuclear protein ( s ) of VD3 - treated HL - 60 cells and THP - 1 cells bound to the CCAAT / enhancer binding protein ( C / EBP ) - binding motif that was located in the upstream region of the MRP14 gene ( - 81 ) , as evidenced by the competitive gel mobility - shift assay . An antibody for C / EBP alpha super - shifted the nucleoprotein complex in THP - 1 cells but not in the VD3 - treated HL - 60 cells , whereas an antibody for C / EBP beta blocked the formation of the complex with the nuclear factor of the HL - 60 cells but not with that of THP - 1 cells . An anti - C / EBP delta antibody had no effect on the complex in either cell . Thus , it was concluded that C / EBP alpha and - beta were able to bind to the C / EBP motif , and that C / EBP alpha bound to the motif in THP - 1 cells and C / EBP beta bound to that in the VD3 - treated HL - 60 cells . Furthermore , to examine the transcriptional activity of the C / EBP motif , we transfected several constructed luciferase reporter DNAs into HL - 60 cells and THP - 1 cells . The luciferase activity of the C / EBP motif in HL - 60 cells was increased by VD3 treatment . The C / EBP motif in the MRP14 gene was confirmed to function as a regulatory region in VD3 - treated HL - 60 cells and THP - 1 cells by the assay . Since C / EBP beta was also detected in VD3 - untreated HL - 60 cells by immunoblotting , VD3 activated C / EBP beta to bind to the motif , probably through post - translational modification . Patients with high - risk myelodysplastic syndrome can have polyclonal or clonal haemopoiesis in complete haematological remission . The clonality of mature peripheral blood - derived myeloid and lymphoid cells and bone marrow haemopoietic progenitors from 18 females with myelodysplasia ( MDS ) ( five refractory anaemia , RA ; one RA with ringed sideroblasts , RARS ; three chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia , CMML ; four RA with excess of blasts , RAEB ; five RAEB in transformation , RAEB - t ) was studied by X - chromosome inactivation analysis . Using the human androgen - receptor ( HUMARA ) assay , we analysed the clonal patterns of highly purified immature CD34 + 38 - and committed CD34 + 38 + marrow - derived progenitors , and CD16 + 14 - granulocytes , CD14 + monocytes , CD3 + T and CD19 + B lymphocytes from peripheral blood . In high - risk patients ( RAEB , RAEB - t ) , clonality analysis was performed before and after intensive remission - induction treatment . All patients , except one with RA , had predominance of a single clone in their granulocytes and monocytes . The same clonal pattern was found in CD34 + progenitor cells . In contrast , CD3 + T lymphocytes were polyclonal or oligoclonal in 14 / 18 patients . X - chromosome inactivation patterns of CD19 + B cells were highly concordant with CD3 + T cells except for two patients ( one RA , one CMML ) with monoclonal B and polyclonal T lymphocytes , therefore suggesting a clonal mutation in a progenitor common to the myeloid and B - lymphoid lineages or the coexistence of MDS and a B - cell disorder in these particular patients . After high - dose non - myeloablative chemotherapy , polyclonal haemopoiesis was reinstalled in the mature myeloid cells and immature and committed marrow progenitors in three of four patients achieving complete haematological remission . Therefore we conclude that most haematological remissions in MDS are associated with restoration of polyclonal haemopoiesis . Prominent sex steroid metabolism in human lymphocytes . Steroid metabolism was investigated in cultured human B - lymphoblastoid cells ( B - LCL ) , and peripheral blood T and B cells . Gene expression was examined by reverse - transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification ( RT - PCR ) . Appropriate sized transcripts were detected in both cultured and fresh peripheral lymphocytes for CYP11A , CYP17 , HSD11L ( 11beta - hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase I ) , HSD17B1 ( 17beta - hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type I ) and SRD5A1 ( 5alpha - reductase I ) . B - LCL , but not T and B cells , expressed CYP11B . There was minimal expression of HSD3B1 and HSD3B2 ( 3beta - hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase I and II ) in B - LCL and T cells . Transcripts for CYP19 and HSD11K were not detected . Corresponding enzymatic activity was detectable only for 17 - hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 5alpha - reductase , respectively producing testosterone and 5alpha - dihydrotestosterone . Steroid identities were confirmed by gas chromatography / mass spectrometry ( GC / MS ) . One metabolite thought to be deoxycorticosterone was identified by GC / MS as 6alpha - hydroxypregnanolone . It was concluded that sex hormone metabolism , including androgen synthesis , occurs in lymphocytes , and may modulate immune response . Human white blood cells and hair follicles are good sources of mRNA for the pterin carbinolamine dehydratase / dimerization cofactor of HNF1 for mutation detection . Pterin carbinolamine dehydratase / dimerization cofactor of HNF1 ( PCD / DCoH ) is a protein that has a dual function . It is a pterin 4alpha - carbinolamine dehydratase that is involved in the regeneration of the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin during the phenylalanine hydroxylase - catalyzed hydroxylation of phenylalanine . In addition , it is the dimerization cofactor of HNF1 that is able to activate the transcriptional activity of HNF1 . Deficiencies in the gene for this dual functional protein result in hyperphenylalaninemi . Here we report for the first time that the PCD / DCoH mRNA is present in human white blood cells and hair follicles . Taking advantage of this finding , a sensitive , rapid and convenient method for screening mutations occurring in the coding region of this gene has been described . Copyright 1998 Academic Press . Biochemical characterization of the NF - Y transcription factor complex during B lymphocyte development . The transcription factor , NF - Y , plays a critical role in tissue - specific major histocompatibility complex class II gene transcription . In this report the biochemical properties of the heterotrimeric NF - Y complex have been characterized during stage - specific B - cell development , and in several class II - mutant B - cell lines , which represent distinct bare lymphocyte syndrome class II genetic complementation groups . The NF - Y complex derived from class II + mature B - cells bound with high affinity to anion exchangers , and eluted as an intact trimeric complex , whereas , NF - Y derived from class II - plasma B - cells , and from bare lymphocyte syndrome group II cell lines , RJ2 . 2 . 5 and RM3 , dissociated into discrete NF - YA and NF - YB : C subunit fractions . Recombination of the MPC11 plasma B - cell derived NF - Y A : B : C complex with the low molecular mass protein fraction , NF - Y - associated factors ( YAFs ) , derived from mature A20 B - cell nuclei , conferred high affinity anion exchange binding to NF - Y as an intact trimeric complex . Recombination of the native NF - YA : B : C complex with the transcriptional cofactor , PC4 , likewise conferred high affinity NF - Y binding to anion exchangers , and stabilized NF - Y interaction with CCAAT - box DNA motifs in vitro . Interaction between PC4 and NF - Y was mapped to the C - terminal region of PC4 , and the subunit interaction subdomain of the highly conserved DNA binding - subunit interaction domain ( DBD ) of NF - YA . These results suggest that in class II + mature B - cells NF - Y is associated with the protein cofactor , PC4 , which may play an important role in NF - Y - mediated transcriptional control of class II genes . Arrest of B lymphocyte terminal differentiation by CD40 signaling : mechanism for lack of antibody - secreting cells in germinal centers . Despite extensive research , the role of CD40 signaling in B cell terminal differentiation remains controversial . Here we show that CD40 engagement arrests B cell differentiation prior to plasma cell formation . This arrest is manifested at a molecular level as a reduction in mRNA levels of secretory immunoglobulin gene products such as mu ( s ) and J chain as well as the loss of the transcriptional regulator BLIMP - 1 . Furthermore , the inhibition of B cell differentiation by CD40 engagement could not be overcome by either mitogens or cytokines , but could be reversed by antibodies that interfere with the CD40 / gp39 interaction . These data suggest that secretory immunoglobulin is not produced by B cells that are actively engaged by gp39 - expressing T cells . A positively charged alpha - lipoic acid analogue with increased cellular uptake and more potent immunomodulatory activity . alpha - Lipoic acid ( LA ) is taken up by cells and reduced to its potent dithiol form , dihydrolipoate ( DHLA ) , much of which is rapidly effluxed out from cells . To improve retention in cells , the LA molecule was modified to confer a positive charge at physiological pH . N , N - dimethyl , N ' - 2 - amidoethyl - lipoate was synthesized . The protonated form of the new molecule is referred to as LA - Plus . The uptake of LA - Plus by human Wurzburg T cells was higher compared to that of LA . Several - fold higher amounts of DHLA - Plus , the corresponding reduced form of LA - Plus , were detected in LA - Plus treated cells compared to the amount of DHLA found in cells treated with LA . At 100 microM , LA did not but LA - Plus inhibited H2O2 induced NF - kappaB activation and NF - kappaB directed IL - 2 receptor expression . Both LA and LA - Plus synergised with selenium in inhibiting H2O2 induced NF - kappaB activation . At 150 microM LA - Plus , but not LA , inhibited TNFalpha induced NF - kappaB activation . At 5 microM LA - Plus , but not LA , protected against both spontaneous and etoposide induced apoptosis in rat thymocytes . LA - Plus is thus an improved form of LA with increased therapeutic potential . Copyright 1998 Academic Press . Carrier identification in X - linked immunodeficiency diseases . OBJECTIVE : Carrier identification in X - linked immunodeficiency disorders can be based on the demonstration of non - random X inactivation ( NRXI ) in affected blood cell lineages when growth is impaired in cells expressing the abnormal gene . We examined the utility of seeking evidence of NRXI to test the carrier status of women in families affected by X - linked severe combined immunodeficiency ( XSCID ) and X - linked hypogammaglobulinaem ( XLH ) , to identify as carriers the mothers of boys with SCID or hypogammaglobulinaem whose phenotype suggested X - linkage and to infer X - linkage in boys with SCID or hypogammaglobulinaem whose disease was not clearly X - linked on the basis either of family history or clinical and immunological characteristics . METHODOLOGY : A polymerase chain reaction - based method was used to amplify a polymorphic CAG repeat in the first exon of the androgen receptor gene after selective digestion of the active X chromosome with a methylation - sensitive enzyme , HpaII to distinguish between the paternal and maternal alleles and to identify their methylation status . RESULTS : Heterozygosity was found in 24 of 31 female subjects ( 77 % ) . As anticipated , NRXI could be demonstrated in all lymphoid cells studied from obligate carriers of XSCID and an obligate carrier of XLH but not on a carrier of X - linked immunodeficiency with hyper - IgM . The finding of NRXI in the mother of a boy with a SCID variant showed her to be a carrier of XSCID and establishes that her son has XSCID , not otherwise evident from available data . CONCLUSIONS : This PCR assay provides a rapid method for carrier detection of X - linked immunodeficiencies , and has allowed us to expand the phenotype of XSCID Leukocyte - endothelial interaction is augmented by high glucose concentrations and hyperglycemia in a NF - kB - dependent fashion . We addressed the role of hyperglycemia in leukocyte - endothelium interaction under flow conditions by exposing human umbilical vein endothelial cells for 24 h to normal ( 5 mM ) , high concentration of glucose ( 30 mM ) , advanced glycosylation end product - albumin ( 100 microg / ml ) , or hyperglycemic ( 174 - 316 mg / dl ) sera from patients with diabetes and abnormal hemoglobin A1c ( 8 . 1 + / - 1 . 4 % ) . At the end of incubation endothelial cells were perfused with total leukocyte suspension in a parallel plate flow chamber under laminar flow ( 1 . 5 dyn / cm2 ) . Rolling and adherent cells were evaluated by digital image processing . Results showed that 30 mM glucose significantly ( P < 0 . 01 ) increased the number of adherent leukocytes to endothelial cells in respect to control ( 5 mM glucose ; 151 + / - 19 versus 33 + / - 8 cells / mm2 ) . A similar response was induced by endothelial stimulation with IL - 1beta , here used as positive control ( 195 + / - 20 cells / mm2 ) . The number of rolling cells on endothelial surface was not affected by high glucose level . Stable adhesion of leukocytes to glucose - treated as well as to IL - 1beta - stimulated endothelial cells was preceded by short interaction of leukocytes with the endothelial surface . The distance travelled by leukocytes before arrest on 30 mM glucose , or on IL - 1beta - treated endothelial cells , was significantly ( P < 0 . 01 ) higher than that observed for leukocytes adhering on control endothelium ( 30 mM glucose : 76 . 7 + / - 3 . 5 ; IL1beta : 69 . 7 + / - 4 versus 5 mM glucose : 21 . 5 + / - 5 microm ) . Functional blocking of E - selectin , intercellular cell adhesion molecule - 1 , and vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 on endothelial cells with the corresponding mouse mAb significantly inhibited glucose - induced increase in leukocyte adhesion ( 67 + / - 16 , 83 + / - 12 , 62 + / - 8 versus 144 + / - 21 cells / mm2 ) . Confocal fluorescence microscopy studies showed that 30 mM glucose induced an increase in endothelial surface expression of E - selectin , intercellular cell adhesion molecule - 1 , and vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 . Electrophoretic mobility shift assay of nuclear extracts of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) exposed for 1 h to 30 mM glucose revealed an intense NF - kB activation . Treatment of HUVEC exposed to high glucose with the NF - kB inhibitors pyrrolidinedithiocar ( 100 microM ) and tosyl - phe - chloromethylketone ( 25 microM ) significantly reduced ( P < 0 . 05 ) leukocyte adhesion in respect to HUVEC treated with glucose alone . A significant ( P < 0 . 01 ) inhibitory effect on glucose - induced leukocyte adhesion was observed after blocking protein kinase C activity with staurosporine ( 5 nM ) . When HUVEC were treated with specific antisense oligodesoxynucleotid against PKCalpha and PKCepsilon isoforms before the addition of 30 mM glucose , a significant ( P < 0 . 05 ) reduction in the adhesion was also seen . Advanced glycosylation end product - albumin significantly increased the number of adhering leukocytes in respect to native albumin used as control ( 110 + / - 16 versus 66 + / - 7 , P < 0 . 01 ) . Sera from diabetic patients significantly ( P < 0 . 01 ) enhanced leukocyte adhesion as compared with controls , despite normal levels of IL - 1beta and TNFalpha in these sera . These data indicate that high glucose concentration and hyperglycemia promote leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium through upregulation of cell surface expression of adhesive proteins , possibly depending on NF - kB activation . Ikaros in hemopoietic lineage determination and homeostasis . Studies on the molecular mechanisms that control hemopoietic differentiation have focused on signaling cascades and nuclear effectors that drive this complex developmental system in a regulated fashion . Here we review the role of Ikaros , the founding member of a unique family of zinc finger transcription factors in this developmental process . Studies on an Ikaros null mutation have revealed an essential role for this factor in lymphoid cell fate determination and at subsequent branch points of the T cell differentiation pathway . Differences in the phenotypes of a null and a dominant negative ( DN ) Ikaros mutation provide insight into a regulatory network through which Ikaros proteins exert their effects in development . In addition a comparative analysis of the hemopoietic stem cell and precursor compartment resulting from the two Ikaros mutations reveals a profound yet not absolute requirement for Ikaros Induction of early B cell factor ( EBF ) and multiple B lineage genes by the basic helix - loop - helix transcription factor E12 . The transcription factors encoded by the E2A and early B cell factor ( EBF ) genes are required for the proper development of B lymphocytes . However , the absence of B lineage cells in E2A - and EBF - deficient mice has made it difficult to determine the function or relationship between these proteins . We report the identification of a novel model system in which the role of E2A and EBF in the regulation of multiple B lineage traits can be studied . We found that the conversion of 70Z / 3 pre - B lymphocytes to cells with a macrophage - like phenotype is associated with the loss of E2A and EBF . Moreover , we show that ectopic expression of the E2A protein E12 in this macrophage line results in the induction of many B lineage genes , including EBF , IL7Ralpha , lambda5 , and Rag - 1 , and the ability to induce kappa light chain in response to mitogen . Activation of EBF may be one of the critical functions of E12 in regulating the B lineage phenotype since expression of EBF alone leads to the activation of a subset of E12 - inducible traits . Our data demonstrate that , in the context of this macrophage line , E12 induces expression of EBF and together these transcription factors coordinately regulate numerous B lineage - associated genes . Activation - induced down - regulation of retinoid receptor RXRalpha expression in human T lymphocytes . Role of cell cycle regulation . A 5 . 4 - kilobase mRNA , the expression of which is down - regulated after treatment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) with various T cell - activating agents , was isolated using an mRNA differential display method . Nucleotide sequence analysis identified the 5 ' end of this RNA as human retinoid receptor RXRalpha mRNA . Here , we report the nucleotide sequence of 3 . 6 kilobases of this RNA , which represents the 3 ' end of RXRalpha mRNA , the sequence of which has not been previously described . Activated PBMCs also expressed lower levels of RXRalpha protein , and a DNA binding assay showed that the activation - induced loss of RXRalpha mRNA and protein expression correlated with the loss of DNA binding activity of this protein . We present evidence that the transition from G0 / G1 to S phase of the cell cycle results in the down - regulation of RXRalpha expression and that cell cycle inhibitors , which block the cells in G1 phase , prevent this down - regulation . The decrease in the levels of RXRalpha mRNA was found to be regulated at the post - transcriptional level and involved new protein synthesis . These observations indicate that the levels of RXRalpha expression in T lymphocytes are coupled to cell cycle progression , and there is tight regulatory control of RXRalpha expression during the transition from G0 / G1 to S phase of the cell cycle . Epidemiology and pathogenesis of AIDS - related lymphomas . Among patients with congenital and acquired immunodeficiencies , non - Hodgkin ' s lymphoma ( NHLs ) are the most common tumors of the immune system . In the setting of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , as many as 10 % to 20 % of people ultimately developed NHLs . These tumors are clinically aggressive , frequently involve extranodal sites , and often exhibit unique features that distinguish them from NHL arising in individuals with other forms of immunosuppression . Important in the development of HIV - associated NHL are cytokines and other factors that induce B - cell proliferation and increase the likelihood of mutations of c - myc , bcl - 6 , and other tumor - suppressor genes with carcinogenic potential . Specific forms of HIV - associated NHL are linked to expression of Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) - latent proteins ; the newly described DNA virus , Karposi ' s sarcoma - associated herpesvirus / human herpesvirus - 8 ( KSHV / HHV - 8 ) ; and perhaps HIV . Elucidation of the factors that contribute to the high incidence of NHL among patients infected with HIV provides insights into important elements of lymphomagenesis . Matrix metalloproteinase expression in human breast cancer : an immunohistochemical study including correlation with cathepsin D , type IV collagen , laminin , fibronectin , EGFR , c - erbB - 2 oncoprotein , p53 , steroid receptors status and proliferative indices . Matrix metalloproteinase s ( MMPs ) are a group of enzymes thought to be responsible for both normal connective tissue matrix remodelling and accelerated breakdown associated with tumour development . The current study aimed to investigate the immunohistochemical expression of matrix metalloproteinase 3 ( MMP - 3 , stromelysin - 1 ) in correlation with the expression of Basement Membrane ( BM ) antigen ( type IV collagen , laminin ) , fibronectin , cathepsin D , p53 , c - erbB - 2 , proliferative activity ( Ki - 67 , PCNA ) , steroid receptor content as well as to the other conventional clinicopathological parameters in breast cancer . This study was performed on a series of frozen and paraffin sections from 84 breast cancer specimens by immunohistochemistry using the monoclonal antibody MMP - 3 ( Ab - 1 ) . Stromelysin - 1 ( ST1 ) was observed in about 10 % of epithelial cells in the control groups ( cases of fibrocystic and benign proliferative breast disease ) , while expression ( > 10 % of expression ) was detected in 89 . 7 % of tumours . The expression of ST1 in carcinoma cells was strongly associated with its presence in the stroma ( p < 0 . 001 ) . A significantly positive correlation was found between ST1 expression , and p53 tumour suppressor gene product ( p = 0 . 004 ) , and a relationship with c - erbB - 2 protein and progesterone receptor status was also indicated . These findings suggest that ST1 expression in breast cancer tissue is irrespective of the expression of the extracellular matrix component , the proteolytic enzyme cathepsin D and the growth fraction of the tumour , and that it could be a potential new prognostic marker in breast cancer . Use of transfected liver cells to evaluate potential mechanisms of alcohol - induced liver injury [ see comments ] There is increased activity of the proinflammatory cytokine , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) in alcoholic liver disease ( ALD ) . Hepatic neutrophil infiltration is a principal injurious manifestation of ALD . TNF can induce cellular oxidative injury directly , and indirectly by inducing neutrophil chemotactic factor ( IL - 8 ) production by hepatocytes . IL - 8 activates and chemotactically attracts neutrophils to the liver where they release oxidizing substances . Patients with ALD also have decreased protective factors for cellular oxidative injury . Manganous superoxide dismutase ( MnSOD ) is an antioxidant protective factor . The objectives of these studies were to investigate mechanisms for induction of an injurious factor ( IL - 8 ) and a protective factor ( MnSOD ) in the HepG2 human hepatoma cell line . In the first set of experiments , IL - 8 gene reporter constructs were used to transiently transfect a derivative ( MVh2E1 - 9 ) of the HepG2 cell line which expresses P - 4502E1 and metabolizes ethanol . Inactivation of the NF - kappaB and 3 ' NF - IL - 6 DNA binding sites decreased IL - 8 gene transcriptional activation in response to TNF while inactivation of the 5 ' NF - IL - 6 binding site increased IL - 8 gene transcriptional activity in response to TNF . This system may be useful to assess the effects of ethanol on TNF - induced hepatocyte IL - 8 production . In the second set of experiments , HepG2 cells were cultured in 25 to 100 mmol concentrations of ethanol . Both TNF and ethanol increased HepG2 cell MnSOD activity in short - term ( 72 hr ) cultures with ethanol . However , after long - term ( 10 weeks ) culture with ethanol , there was no induction of MnSOD by ethanol and there was a diminished induction of MnSOD in response to TNF . Further studies are needed to assess the effect of this diminished induction of MnSOD with chronic ethanol culture on HepG2 cell susceptibility to TNF cytotoxicity . We conclude that transfected liver cell lines can be used to evaluate mechanisms for increased injurious factors and decreased protective factors in alcoholic liver injury . Tissue factor transcription driven by Egr - 1 is a critical mechanism of murine pulmonary fibrin deposition in hypoxia . Local hypoxemia and stasis trigger thrombosis . We have demonstrated previously that in a murine model of normobaric hypoxia pulmonary fibrin deposition is a result of expression of tissue factor , especially in oxygen - deprived mononuclear phagocytes ( MPs ) . We now show that transcription factor early - growth - response gene product ( Egr - 1 ) is rapidly activated in hypoxia , both in vitro and in vivo , and is responsible for transcription and expression of tissue factor in hypoxic lung . MPs and HeLa cells subjected to hypoxia ( pO2 approximately 13 torr ) had increased levels of tissue factor transcripts ( approximately 18 - fold ) and an increased rate of transcription ( approximately 15 - fold ) , based on nuclear run - on analysis . Gel - shift analysis of nuclear extracts from hypoxic MPs and HeLa cells demonstrated increased DNA - binding activity at the serum response region ( SRR ; - 111 / + 14 bp ) of the tissue factor promoter at Egr - 1 motifs . Using 32P - labeled Egr consensus oligonucleotide , we observed induction of DNA - binding activity in nuclear extracts from hypoxic lung and HeLa cells because of activation of Egr - 1 , by means of supershift analysis . Transient transfection of HeLa cells with chimeric plasmids containing wild - type or mutant SRR from the tissue factor promoter showed that intact Sp1 sites are necessary for basal promoter activity , whereas the integrity of Egr - 1 sites was required for hypoxia - enhanced expression . A central role for Egr - 1 in hypoxia - mediated tissue factor expression was confirmed by experiments with homozygous Egr - 1 null mice ; wild - type mice subjected to oxygen deprivation expressed tissue factor and showed fibrin deposition , but hypoxic homozygous Egr - 1 null mice displayed neither tissue factor nor fibrin . These data delineate a novel biology for hypoxia - induced fibrin deposition , in which oxygen deprivation - induced activation of Egr - 1 , resulting in expression of tissue factor , has an unexpected and central role . Kinetics of cytokine and NFAT gene expression in human interleukin - 2 - dependent T lymphoblasts stimulated via T - cell receptor . T cells respond to mitogenic or antigenic stimulation by proliferation and by turning on cytokine gene expression . Here we have analysed the kinetics and nature of cytokine production in human peripheral blood - derived T lymphoblasts stimulated with anti - CD3 antibodies or Lens culinaris lectin ( LCL ) . T cells were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) and primarily activated with anti - CD3 antibodies and cultured in the presence of interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) . Anti - CD3 - restimulated T cells ( mainly CD8 + ) produced IL - 2 , interferon - gamma ( IFN - gamma ) and tumour necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF - alpha ) and low levels of IL - 4 and IL - 10 transcripts and proteins . No IL - 6 gene expression was observed . In LCL - stimulated cells the cytokine production pattern was very similar . Steady - state mRNA levels of IL - 2 , IL - 10 and IFN - gamma peaked at 3 hr after anti - CD3 stimulation and declined rapidly thereafter . The kinetics of TNF - alpha mRNA expression was faster , being at its peak level 1 hr after stimulation . Anti - CD3 - stimulated IL - 2 gene expression was down - regulated by protein synthesis inhibitor , whereas IL - 10 , IFN - gamma and TNF - alpha genes were readily induced independent of ongoing protein synthesis . T - cell receptor stimulation also induced a very rapid expression of c - jun , c - fos and NFATc1 ( NFATc ) genes , the gene products of which are involved in cytokine gene expression . In conclusion , the cytokines synthesized by IL - 2 - dependent T cells were predominantly IL - 2 , IFN - gamma and TNF - alpha . An animal model to study local oxidation of LDL and its biological effects in the arterial wall . Oxidized LDL ( oxLDL ) is present in atherosclerotic lesions and is believed to play a key role in atherogenesis . Mainly on the basis of cell culture studies , oxLDL has been shown to produce many biological effects that influence the atherosclerotic process . To study LDL oxidation in vivo , we have established a model in which Sprague - Dawley rats are given a single injection of unmodified human LDL ( > or = 4 mg / kg body weight ) . Within 6 hours , an accumulation of apolipoprotein B and epitopes present on oxLDL are detected in the arterial endothelium and media . The presence of oxLDL is associated with activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor - kappaB in the endothelium as well as endothelial expression of intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 . Injection of LDL enriched with the antioxidant probucol resulted in arterial accumulation of apolipoprotein B , but the expression of oxLDL - specific epitopes was reduced at 24 hours . Thus , this simple model has the potential to analyze the mechanisms behind and biological effects of LDL oxidation in vivo . Molecular mechanisms of promoter regulation of the gp34 gene that is trans - activated by an oncoprotein Tax of human T cell leukemia virus type I . We investigated the molecular mechanism of transcriptional activation of the gp34 gene by the Tax oncoprotein of human T cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV - I ) . gp34 is a type II transmembrane molecule belonging to the tumor necrosis factor family and is constitutively expressed on HTLV - I - producing cells but not normal resting T cells . The transcriptional regulatory region of the gp34 gene was activated by HTLV - I Tax in the human T cell line Jurkat , in which endogenous gp34 is induced by Tax . Sequence analysis demonstrated that two NF - kappaB - like elements ( 1 and 2 ) were present in the regulatory region . Both NF - kappaB - like elements were able to bind to NF - kappaB or its related factor ( s ) in a Tax - dependent manner . Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays indicated that NF - kappaB - like element 1 was Tax - responsive , although the activity was lower than that the native promoter . NF - kappaB - like element 2 elevated promoter activity when combined with NF - kappaB - like element 1 , indicating cooperative function of the elements for maximum promoter function . Unlike typical NF - kappaB elements , the NF - kappaB - like elements in gp34 were not activated by treatment of Jurkat cells with phorbol ester despite induction of the NF - kappaB - like binding activity . Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter assays using the region upstream of the NF - kappaB - like elements identified an upstream region that reduced transcription from cognate and noncognate core promoters in a Tax - independent manner . Our results imply complex regulation of expression of the gp34 gene and suggest implication of gp34 in proliferation of HTLV - I infected T cells . beta - Amyloid fibrils activate parallel mitogen - activated protein kinase pathways in microglia and THP1 monocytes . The senile plaques of Alzheimer ' s disease are foci of local inflammatory responses , as evidenced by the presence of acute phase proteins and oxidative damage . Fibrillar forms of beta - amyloid ( Abeta ) , which are the primary constituents of senile plaques , have been shown to activate tyrosine kinase - dependent signal transduction cascades , resulting in inflammatory responses in microglia . However , the downstream signaling pathways mediating Abeta - induced inflammatory events are not well characterized . We report that exposure of primary rat microglia and human THP1 monocytes to fibrillar Abeta results in the tyrosine kinase - dependent activation of two parallel signal transduction cascades involving members of the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) superfamily . Abeta stimulated the rapid , transient activation of extracellular signal - regulated kinase 1 ( ERK1 ) and ERK2 in microglia and ERK2 in THP1 monocytes . A second superfamily member , p38 MAPK , was also activated with similar kinetics . Scavenger receptor and receptor for advanced glycated end products ( RAGE ) ligands failed to activate ERK and p38 MAPK in the absence of significant increases in protein tyrosine phosphorylation , demonstrating that scavenger receptors and RAGE are not linked to these pathways . Importantly , the stress - activated protein kinases ( SAPKs ) were not significantly activated in response to Abeta . Downstream effectors of the MAPK signal transduction cascades include MAPKAP kinases , such as RSK1 and RSK2 , as well as transcription factors . Exposure of microglia and THP1 monocytes to Abeta resulted in the activation of RSK1 and RSK2 and phosphorylation of cAMP response element - binding protein at Ser133 , providing a mechanism for Abeta - induced changes in gene expression Regulation of cellular retinoic acid binding protein ( CRABP II ) during human monocyte differentiation in vitro . Cellular retinoic acid binding proteins ( CRABP ) are low molecular weight proteins whose precise function remains unknown . They bind retinoids and may thereby modulate the intracellular steady - state concentration of retinoids . Whereas CRABP I is ubiquitously expressed , CRABP II is mainly detected in various cell types of the skin . By representative difference analysis we found that CRABP II is also strongly expressed in human monocyte - derived macrophages ( MAC ) but not in freshly isolated monocytes ( MO ) . The CRABP II mRNA was gradually upregulated during differentiation from MO to MAC in the presence of 2 % serum . Adherence , which is important for MO differentiation , induced CRABP II expression , but the addition of 10 ( - 7 ) M retinoic acid inhibited the upregulation of CRABP II expression during MO / MAC differentiation . As MO can differentiate along the classical pathway not only to MAC but also to dendritic cells we analyzed the expression of CRABP II in MO - derived dendritic cells cultured with 10 % FCS , IL - 4 , and GM - CSF . In contrast to MAC , MO - derived dendritic cells showed an extremely low expression of CRABP II . From these results we conclude ( 1 ) that the availability and the metabolism of retinoids may be different in MAC compared to MO and dendritic cells and ( 2 ) that this may influence differentiation and activation of those cells . Transcription factor B - cell - specific activator protein ( BSAP ) is differentially expressed in B cells and in subsets of B - cell lymphomas . The paired box containing gene PAX - 5 encodes the transcription factor BSAP ( B - cell - specific activator protein ) , which plays a key role in B - lymphocyte development . Despite its known involvement in a rare subtype of non - Hodgkin ' s lymphoma ( NHL ) , a detailed examination of BSAP expression in NHL has not been previously reported . In this study , we analyzed normal and malignant lymphoid tissues and cell lines , including 102 cases of B - cell NHL , 23 cases of T - and null - cell NHL , and 18 cases of Hodgkin ' s disease . Normal lymphoid tissues showed strong nuclear BSAP expression in mantle zone B cells , less intense reactivity in follicular center B cells , and no expression in cells of the T - cell - rich zones . Monocytoid B cells showed weak expression , whereas plasma cells and extrafollicular large transformed B cells were negative . Of the 102 B - cell NHLs , 83 ( 81 % ) demonstrated BSAP expression . All of the 13 ( 100 % ) B - cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias ( B - CLLs ) , 21 of ( 100 % ) mantle cells ( MCLs ) , and 20 of 21 ( 95 % ) follicular lymphomas ( FLs ) were positive . Moderate staining intensities were found in most B - CLL and FL cases , whereas most MCLs showed strong reactions , paralleling the strong reactivity of nonmalignant mantle cells . Eight of 12 ( 67 % ) marginal zone lymphoma cases showed negative or low BSAP levels , and 17 of 24 ( 71 % ) large B - cell lymphomas displayed moderate to strong expression . None of the 23 T - and null - cell lymphomas reacted with the BSAP antisera , whereas in Hodgkin ' s disease , 2 of 4 ( 50 % ) nodular lymphocytic predominance and 5 of 14 ( 36 % ) classical cases showed weak nuclear or nucleolar BSAP reactions in a fraction of the tumor cells . Western blot analysis showed a 52 - kD BSAP band in B - cell lines , but not in non - B - cell or plasma cell lines . We conclude that BSAP expression is largely restricted to lymphomas of B - cell lineage and that BSAP expression varies in B - cell subsets and subtypes of B - cell NHL . The high levels of BSAP , especially those found in large - cell lymphomas and in some follicular lymphomas , may be a consequence of deregulated gene expression and suggest a possible involvement of PAX - 5 in certain B - cell malignancies . This is a US government work . There are no restrictions on its use . Mitogen and growth factor - induced activation of a STAT - like molecule in channel catfish lymphoid cells . This article describes the identification of a putative STAT molecule in the channel catfish ( Ictalurus punctatus ) , the first report of such a molecule in a ' lower ' vertebrate . A monoclonal antibody against human STAT6 recognizes an approximately 100 kDa molecule that becomes activated and translocates to the nucleus upon both growth factor and mitogen stimulation of catfish leukocytes . This presumed catfish STAT binds the mammalian interferon - gamma activation site , a known motif of mammalian STAT binding , as shown by electromobility shift assays . Purification of the proteins present in these DNA complexes confirms that the catfish reactive molecule binds to the interferon - gamma activation site sequence . These results suggest that STAT molecules have been highly conserved in vertebrate evolution . Isolation and analysis of a T cell clone variant exhibiting constitutively phosphorylated Ser133 cAMP response element - binding protein . In driving T cell proliferation , IL - 2 stimulates a new program of gene expression that includes proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) , a requisite processivity factor for DNA polymerase delta . PCNA transcription is regulated in part through tandem CRE sequences in the promoter and CRE binding proteins ; IL - 2 stimulates CREB phosphorylation in the resting cloned T lymphocyte , L2 . After culturing L2 cells for greater than 91 days , we consistently isolate a stable variant that exhibits constitutive CREB phosphorylation . L2 and L2 variant cells were tested for IL - 2 responsiveness and rapamycin sensitivity with respect to specific kinase activity , PCNA expression and proliferation . In L2 cells , IL - 2 stimulated and rapamycin inhibited the following : cAMP - independent CREB kinase activity , PCNA expression and proliferation . In L2 variant cells , CREB kinase activity was constitutively high ; IL - 2 stimulated and rapamycin blocked PCNA expression and proliferation . These results indicate that IL - 2 induces a rapamycin - sensitive , cAMP - independent CREB kinase activity in L2 cells . However , phosphorylation of CREB alone is not sufficient to drive PCNA expression and L2 cell proliferation in the absence of IL - 2 . Serotonin derivative , N - ( p - coumaroyl ) serotonin , inhibits the production of TNF - alpha , IL - 1alpha , IL - 1beta , and IL - 6 by endotoxin - stimulated human blood monocytes . We have reported that N - ( p - coumaroyl ) serotonin ( CS ) and its derivatives with antioxidative activity are present in safflower seeds . As reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) are implicated in the signaling of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , we examined whether CS has a suppressive effect on inflammatory cytokine generation from human monocyte s in vitro . CS at 50 - 200 microM reduced tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) , interleukin - 1 ( IL - 1 ) , and IL - 6 activities in the culture supernatants from LPS - stimulated human blood monocytes without cytotoxicity . ELISA assay revealed that the production of TNF - alpha , IL - 1alpha , IL - 1beta , and IL - 6 was inhibited by CS . Northern blot analysis showed that LPS - induced expression of these cytokine mRNA in monocytes was suppressed by CS . NF - kappaB activation was also inhibited by CS . These findings indicate that CS has a suppressive effect on proinflammatory cytokine production from monocytes , and this effect is based in part on the suppression of cytokine mRNA expression through inhibition of NF - kappaB activation . Elevated expression of differentiation inhibitory factor nm23 mRNA in monoblastic crisis of a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia . Differentiation inhibitory factor nm23 gene has been found to be expressed in high quantities in acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) , especially in acute monocytic leukemia ( AML - M5 ) and is suggested as a new prognostic factor in AML - M5 . We report an example of elevated expression of nm23 mRNA in a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) who developed monoblastic crisis . Relative levels of nm23 - H1 and - H2 mRNA extracted from the patient ' s peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bone marrow mononuclear cells were measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction . The level of nm23 - H1 mRNA in CML cells at the chronic phase was as high as that in bone marrow cells from healthy volunteers . The mRNA level of nm23 - H2 was slightly below the normal level . At blastic crisis , however , expression of both nm23 - H1 and - H2 mRNA was elevated to about three to nine times of that at the chronic phase . Proliferated blastic cells were positive for non - specific esterase , and the serum lysozyme level was elevated and diagnosed as monoblastic crisis . The patient received combined chemotherapy but response was partial . These findings are compatible with our previous report that nm23 gene is overexpressed in monocytic leukemia . Increased transcription decreases the spontaneous mutation rate at the thymidine kinase locus in human cells . Transcription increases DNA repair efficiency and modulates the distribution of certain types of DNA damage . Furthermore , increased transcription level stimulates spontaneous mutation rate in yeast . We explored whether transcription level affects spontaneous mutation rate in human cells . We first developed two thymidine kinase ( tk ) inducible human cell lines using the Gal4 - Estrogen receptor system . In our TK6i - G3 and G9 tk heterozygous cell lines , the active tk allele is linked to an inducible promoter element . Tk mRNA is induced following treatment with estrogen . Spontaneous mutation rate was significantly decreased in human cell lines after induction in contrast to the report in yeast . Thus , humans may have evolved different or additional mechanisms to deal with transcription related spontaneous mutagenesis . Copyright 1998 Elsevier Science B . V . All rights reserved . Mutation of BCL - 6 gene in normal B cells by the process of somatic hypermutation of Ig genes . Immunoglobulin ( Ig ) genes are hypermutated in B lymphocytes that are the precursors to memory B cells . The mutations are linked to transcription initiation , but non - Ig promoters are permissible for the mutation process ; thus , other genes expressed in mutating B cells may also be subject to somatic hypermutation . Significant mutations were not observed in c - MYC , S14 , or alpha - fetoprotein ( AFP ) genes , but BCL - 6 was highly mutated in a large proportion of memory B cells of normal individuals . The mutation pattern was similar to that of Ig genes . CD28 - mediated activation in CD45RA + and CD45RO + T cells : enhanced levels of reactive oxygen intermediates and c - Rel nuclear translocation in CD45RA + cells . We have analyzed the effect of complete T cell activation ( anti - CD3 plus anti - CD28 ) on the activation of NF - kappaB in CD45RA + ( naive ) and CD45RO + ( memory / effector ) T cells . Long exposure ( 24 h ) induced stronger NF - kappaB DNA binding in CD45RA + cells than in CD45RO + cells . Analysis of the nuclear c - Rel protein indicated that after anti - CD3 + anti - CD28 stimulation the level of c - Rel was higher in CD45RA + cells . Analysis of the cytoplasmic inhibitor IkappaBalpha indicated that anti - CD3 + anti - CD28 stimulation induced a long - lasting degradation in CD45RA + cells but in CD45RO + cells the degradation process was more rapid . Because the CD28 costimulus is known to induce the production of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROIs ) , the intracellular ROI levels in CD45RA + and CD45RO + cells were compared by flow cytometry . ROIs were produced in both cell types , but more strongly in CD45RA + cells . The data presented in this study further emphasize the differences between CD45RA + and CD45RO + T lymphocytes in ROI - dependent signaling pathways . Non - Hodgkin ' s lymphoma involving bilateral breasts [ see comments ] We describe here two cases of diffuse large cell type non - Hodgkin ' s lymphoma affecting the bilateral breasts . The contralateral tumor in one case appeared 17 months after the first mastectomy , whereas the bilateral tumors occurred concurrently in the other patient who was pregnant and showed widespread dissemination at initial presentation . Lymphoma cells from both cases showed the mature B - cell immunophenotype and had rearrangements of the BCL6 gene . Both patients developed progressive disease despite chemo - radiotherapy and died of leukemic manifestations . There were no apparent pathological features of lymphomas of mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue origin Biochemical characterization of MIP - 1 alpha nuclear protein . A family of hematopoietic specific transcription factors , MIP - 1 alpha nuclear protein ( MNP ) family , has recently been identified . They are intimately involved in regulating the transcription of the huMIP - 1 alpha gene in monocytes , T - cells , and transformed B - cells . One member of the family ( MNP - 1 ) is essential for promoter activity in monocytes and B - cells , while another ( MNP - 2 ) is required for full promotor activity in T - cells . A third member of the family ( MNP - 3 ) is expressed in PMA induced HL60 cells and probably has a role in monocyte differentiation . In this communication we demonstrate by two techniques that MNP - 1 and MNP - 2 are distinct but related factors , and we present further evidence to show that MNP - 1 acts as a heterodimer . Bcl - 3 expression and nuclear translocation are induced by granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor and erythropoietin in proliferating human erythroid precursors . Bcl - 3 is a proto - oncogene involved in the chromosomal translocation t ( 14 ; 19 ) found in some patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia . It shares structural similarities with and is a member of the IkappaB family of proteins . In this report , involvement of Bcl - 3 in hematopoietic growth factor - stimulated erythroid proliferation and differentiation was examined . In TF - 1 cells , an erythroleukemia cell line , granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) and erythropoietin ( Epo ) greatly enhanced Bcl - 3 expression at both the protein and mRNA levels in association with stimulation of proliferation . Bcl - 3 protein was also highly expressed in early burst - forming unit - erythroid ( BFU - E ) - derived erythroid precursors ( day 7 ) and decreased during maturation ( days 10 and 14 ) , suggesting that Bcl - 3 is involved in normal erythroid proliferation . In these hematopoietic cells , Bcl - 3 was hyperphosphorylated . GM - CSF and Epo modulated the subcellular localization of Bcl - 3 . Upon stimulation of TF - 1 cells with GM - CSF or Epo , the nuclear translocation of Bcl - 3 was dramatically enhanced . Overexpression of Bcl - 3 in TF - 1 cells by transient transfection along with the NF - kappaB factors p50 or p52 resulted in significant induction of an human immunodeficiency virus - type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) kappaB - TATA - luceriferase reporter plasmid , demonstrating that Bcl - 3 has a positive role in transactivation of kappaB - containing genes in erythroid cells . Stimulation with GM - CSF enhanced c - myb mRNA expression in these cells . Bcl - 3 in nuclear extracts of TF - 1 cells bound to a kappaB enhancer in the c - myb promoter together with NF - kappaB2 / p52 and this binding activity was enhanced by GM - CSF stimulation . Furthermore , cotransfection of Bcl - 3 with p52 or p50 in TF - 1 cells resulted in significant activation of a c - myb kappaB - TATA - luceriferase reporter plasmid . These findings suggest that Bcl - 3 may participate in the transcriptional regulation of certain kappaB - containing genes involved in hematopoiesis , including c - myb .

A region of basic amino acids spanning residues 639 - 656 in the human 5 - lipoxygenase sequence resembles a consensus bipartite nuclear localizing sequence . A synthetic peptide consisting of the Kaposi fibroblast growth factor signal sequence fused to the 5 - lipoxygenase639 - 656 bipartite nuclear localizing sequence has a prominent inhibitory effect on 5 - lipoxygenase catalysis in granulocytic HL - 60 cells activated by calcium ionophor A23187 . Recombinant 5 - lipoxygenase was not affected by the peptide . The peptide also inhibited redistribution of 5 - lipoxygenase from the cytosol to the nuclear membrane of HL - 60 cells stimulated by A23187 . 5 - Lipoxygenase protein was detected in nuclear factor kappaB ( NF - kappaB ) p65 subunit immunoprecipitate fractions prepared from HL - 60 cell lysates . The amount of 5 - lipoxygenase protein coimmunoprecipitated by NF - kappaB antiserum was increased following A23187 stimulation . In cells treated with agents that block 5 - lipoxygenase translocation to the nucleus , 5 - lipoxygenase protein appearing in the NF - kappaB immunoprecipitate was diminished . Our results implicate an internal bipartite nuclear localizing sequence as a regulatory domain that modulates 5 - lipoxygenase redistribution and catalysis in granulocytic cells . Additionally , our results suggest that molecular determinants which govern 5 - lipoxygenase and NF - kappaB redistribution to the nucleus may be coordinately controlled in granulocytic cells .

Inhibition of CD28 / CD3 - mediated costimulation of naive and memory human T lymphocytes by intracellular incorporation of polyclonal antibodies specific for the activator protein - 1 transcriptional complex . A number of indirect methods have been utilized in demonstrating activator protein - 1 transcription factor function in IL - 2 promoter activity . However , there has been no direct demonstration that activator protein - 1 is involved in CD28 - dependent costimulation of IL - 2 gene transcription in freshly isolated naive and memory human T lymphocytes . To address this issue , the method of scrape loading was applied to purified peripheral blood T lymphocytes . Since scrape loading relies on adherent cells , peripheral blood human T ( PB - T ) cells were immobilized on the nonspecific cell attachment factor poly - L - lysine . Cells scraped off poly - L - lysine in the presence of Ig FITC efficiently incorporated Ig , with relatively uniform fluorescence . T cells retained their physical parameters as measured by forward and side light scatter , and functional activity as measured by costimulation of proliferation and IL - 2 production after being scraped off this substrate . CD28 / CD3 - costimulated T cells produced intracellular IL - 2 from all subsets measured ( CD4 + , CD4 - , CD45RO + , and CD45RO - ) . IL - 2 production and intracellular accumulation in nonscraped PB - T cells activated with CD28 / CD3 coligation were skewed favoring CD45RO + and CD4 + subsets , as was IL - 2 production in scraped PB - T cells . The intracellular incorporation of Abs specific for c - Fos and c - Jun family members by scrape loading inhibited the production and intracellular accumulation of IL - 2 within 6 h of costimulation with PMA / ionomycin , or costimulation by CD28 and CD3 ligation . Scrape loading thus provides an efficient mechanism for intracellular incorporation of macromolecules , and the first direct evidence that c - Fos and c - Jun are involved in transcription of the IL - 2 gene within its correct chromosomal context , in resting human T lymphocyte subpopulations . Differential expression of Nur77 family members in human T - lymphotropic virus type 1 - infected cells : transactivation of the TR3 / nur77 gene by Tax protein . We analyzed the differential expression and regulation of three members of the Nur77 transcription factor family by the human T - lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV - 1 ) Tax protein . We have demonstrated that in both HTLV - 1 - infected cells and Tax - expressing JPX - 9 cells , TR3 / nur77 is highly expressed , whereas neither NOR - 1 nor NOT expression is detectable . Transient transfection analysis further confirmed the Tax transactivation of the TR3 / nur77 promoter but not the NOR - 1 promoter in different cell types . Furthermore , expression of a luciferase reporter gene driven by the NGFI - B ( rat homolog of TR3 / Nur77 ) response element ( NBRE ) provided evidence that Tax - mediated transactivation resulted in the induction of a functional protein . Cotransfection assays with the TR3 / nur77 promoter sequence or the NBRE binding motif together with a series of Tax mutants have shown that Tax - induced TR3 / nur77 expression is mediated by CREB / ATF - related transcription factors . Negative regulation of the heat shock transcriptional response by HSBP1 . In response to stress , heat shock factor 1 ( HSF1 ) acquires rapid DNA binding and transient transcriptional activity while undergoing conformational transition from an inert non - DNA - binding monomer to active functional trimers . Attenuation of the inducible transcriptional response occurs during heat shock or upon recovery at non - stress conditions and involves dissociation of the HSF1 trimer and loss of activity . We have used the hydrophobic repeats of the HSF1 trimerization domain in the yeast two - hybrid protein interaction assay to identify heat shock factor binding protein 1 ( HSBP1 ) , a novel , conserved , 76 - amino - acid protein that contains two extended arrays of hydrophobic repeats that interact with the HSF1 heptad repeats . HSBP1 is nuclear - localized and interacts in vivo with the active trimeric state of HSF1 that appears during heat shock . During attenuation of HSF1 to the inert monomer , HSBP1 associates with Hsp70 . HSBP1 negatively affects HSF1 DNA - binding activity , and overexpression of HSBP1 in mammalian cells represses the transactivation activity of HSF1 . To establish a biological role for HSBP1 , the homologous Caenorhabditis elegans protein was overexpressed in body wall muscle cells and was shown to block activation of the heat shock response from a heat shock promoter - reporter construct . Alteration in the level of HSBP1 expression in C . elegans has severe effects on survival of the animals after thermal and chemical stress , consistent with a role for HSBP1 as a negative regulator of the heat shock response . Long - range transcriptional regulation of cytokine gene expression . Most studies on the control of cytokine gene expression have involved the functional analysis of proximal promoters . Recent work has identified distal elements that mediate long - range cytokine gene regulation and has implicated chromatin reorganization in regulation of cytokine gene loci . These studies have begun to elucidate the basis for cell - specificity and high - level expression of cytokine genes . A signaling complex of Ca2 + - calmodulin - dependent protein kinase IV and protein phosphatase 2A [ see comments ] Stimulation of T lymphocytes results in a rapid increase in intracellular calcium concentration ( [ Ca2 + ] i ) that parallels the activation of Ca2 + - calmodulin - dependent protein kinase IV ( CaMKIV ) , a nuclear enzyme that can phosphorylate and activate the cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) response element - binding protein ( CREB ) . However , inactivation of CaMKIV occurs despite the sustained increase in [ Ca2 + ] i that is required for T cell activation . A stable and stoichiometric complex of CaMKIV with protein serine - threonine phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) was identified in which PP2A dephosphorylates CaMKIV and functions as a negative regulator of CaMKIV signaling . In Jurkat T cells , inhibition of PP2A activity by small t antigen enhanced activation of CREB - mediated transcription by CaMKIV . These findings reveal an intracellular signaling mechanism whereby a protein serine - threonine kinase ( CaMKIV ) is regulated by a tightly associated protein serine - threonine phosphatase ( PP2A ) . Hypoxia down - regulates MCP - 1 expression : implications for macrophage distribution in tumors . Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ( MCP - 1 ) is likely to contribute to the macrophage infiltrate in human ovarian carcinomas . Although MCP - 1 is predominantly expressed by the tumor parenchyma , macrophages accumulate at highest density in necrotic regions , which are associated with low oxygen tensions . Tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - alpha ) can stimulate MCP - 1 production and is also present within ovarian carcinomas . We have investigated the effect of hypoxia both on MCP - 1 expression in ovarian cancer cell lines and monocyte migration . Hypoxia down - regulated TNF - alpha - induced MCP - 1 mRNA and protein production by ovarian cancer cells . The effect was mimicked by cobalt chloride and desferrioxamine , consistent with a specific oxygen - sensing mechanism . Unlike antioxidants , hypoxia did not inhibit nuclear factor KB mobilization . Monocyte migration in response to MCP - 1 was also diminished under hypoxic conditions . Down - regulation of MCP - 1 expression and the inhibition of monocyte migration are independent effects of hypoxia that may contribute to the distribution of macrophages within ovarian tumors . Activation of nuclear factor kappa B inflammatory bowel disease [ see comments ] BACKGROUND : Expression of pro - inflammatory cytokines is increased in the intestinal lamina propria of patients with inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . Nuclear factor kappa B ( NF kappa B ) controls transcription of inflammation genes . On activation , NF kappa B is rapidly released from its cytoplasmic inhibitor ( I kappa B ) , transmigrates into the nucleus , and binds to DNA response elements in gene promoter regions . AIMS : To investigate whether increased activation of NF kappa B is important in IBD and may be down - regulated by anti - inflammatory treatment . METHODS : Activation of NF kappa B was determined by western blot assessment and electrophoretic mobility shift assay in nuclear extracts of colonic biopsy samples as well as lamina propria mononuclear cells . RESULTS : Nuclear levels of NF kappa B p65 are increased in lamina propria biopsy specimens from patients with Crohn ' s disease in comparison with patients with ulcerative colitis and controls . Increased activation of NF kappa B was detected in lamina propria mononuclear cells from patients with active IBD . Corticosteroids strongly inhibit intestinal NF kappa B activation in IBD in vivo and in vitro by stabilising the cytosolic inhibitor I kappa B alpha against activation induced degradation . CONCLUSIONS : In both IBDs , but particularly Crohn ' s disease , increased activation of NF kappa B may be involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response . Inhibition of NF kappa B activation may represent a mechanism by which steroids exert an anti - inflammatory effect in IBD Insufficient glycemic control increases nuclear factor - kappa B binding activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from patients with type 1 diabetes . OBJECTIVE : The redox - sensitive transcription factor nuclear factor - kappa B ( NF - kappa B ) is believed to contribute to late diabetic complications . It is unknown whether NF - kappa B is influenced by glycemic control . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : To determine whether NF - kappa B is activated in patients with insufficient glycemic control ( HbA1c > 10 % ) , we developed a tissue culture - independent electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) - based semiquantitative detection system that allowed us to determine NF - kappa B activation in ex vivo - isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) . We included 43 patients with type 1 diabetes in this cross - sectional study . 10 of those received the antioxidant thioctic acid ( 600 mg / day p . o . ) for 2 weeks . RESULTS : Monocytes of patients with HbA1c levels > 10 % demonstrated significantly higher NF - kappa B binding activity in an EMSA and a stronger NF - kappa B staining in immunohistochemistry than monocytes of patients with HbA1c levels of 6 - 8 % . The increase in NF - kappa B activation correlated with an increase in plasmatic markers of lipid peroxidation . Treatment with the antioxidant thioctic acid decreased NF - kappa B binding activity . CONCLUSIONS : Hyperglycemia induces activation of the transcription factor NF - kappa B in ex vivo - isolated PBMCs of patients with type 1 diabetes . NF - kappa B activation is at least partially dependent on oxidative stress , since the antioxidant thioctic acid significantly lowered the extent of NF - kappa B binding activity . Synergistic activation of MAP kinase ( ERK1 / 2 ) by erythropoietin and stem cell factor is essential for expanded erythropoiesis . Stem cell factor ( SCF ) and erythropoietin ( EPO ) work synergistically to support erythropoiesis , but the mechanism for this synergism is unknown . By using purified human erythroid colony - forming cells ( ECFC ) , we have found that SCF and EPO synergistically activate MAP kinase ( MAPK , ERK1 / 2 ) , which correlates with the cell growth and thus may be responsible for the synergistic effects . Treatment of the cells with PD98059 and wortmannin , inhibitors of MEK and PI - 3 kinase , respectively , inhibited the synergistic activation of MAPK and also the cell growth , further supporting this conclusion . Wortmannin only inhibits MAPK activation induced by EPO but not that by SCF , suggesting that SCF and EPO may activate MAPK through different pathways , which would facilitate synergy . Furthermore , EPO , but not SCF , led to activation of STAT5 , whereas SCF and wortmannin had no effect on the EPO - induced STAT5 activation , suggesting that STAT5 is not involved in the synergistic action of SCF and EPO . Together , the data suggest that synergistic activation of MAPK by SCF and EPO is essential for expanded erythropoiesis . Copyright 1998 by The American Society of Hematology . The molecular and phenotypic profile of primary central nervous system lymphoma identifies distinct categories of the disease and is consistent with histogenetic derivation from germinal center - related B cells . Primary central nervous system lymphoma ( PCNSL ) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) - infected individuals . The precise histogenetic derivation and the molecular pathogenesis of PCNSL is poorly understood . In an attempt to clarify the histogenesis and pathogenesis of these lymphomas , 49 PCNSL ( 26 acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [ AIDS ] - related and 23 AIDS - unrelated ) were analyzed for multiple biologic markers , which are known to bear histogenetic and pathogenetic significance for mature B - cell neoplasms . PCNSL associated frequently ( 50 . 0 % ) with mutations of BCL - 6 5 ' noncoding regions , which are regarded as a marker of B - cell transition through the germinal center ( GC ) . Expression of BCL - 6 protein , which is restricted to GC B cells throughout physiologic B - cell maturation , was detected in 100 % AIDS - unrelated PCNSL and in 56 . 2 % AIDS - related cases . Notably , among AIDS - related PCNSL , expression of BCL - 6 was mutually exclusive with expression of Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) - encoded latent membrane protein ( LMP ) - 1 and , with few exceptions , also of BCL - 2 . All but one PCNSL expressed hMSH2 , which among mature B cells selectively stains GC B cells . These data suggest that PCNSL may be frequently related to GC B cells and may be segregated into two major biologic categories based on the expression pattern of BCL - 6 , LMP - 1 , and BCL - 2 . BCL - 6 ( + ) / LMP - 1 ( - ) / BCL - 2 ( - ) PCNSL occur both in the presence and in the absence of HIV infection and consistently display a large noncleaved cell morphology . Conversely , BCL - 6 ( - ) / LMP - 1 ( + ) / BCL - 2 ( + ) PCNSL are restricted to HIV - infected hosts and are represented by lymphomas with immunoblastic features . These data are relevant for the pathogenesis and histogenesis of PCNSL and may be helpful to segregate distinct biologic and prognostic categories of these lymphomas .

Regulation of adhesion molecule expression and function by reactive oxygen species via specific redox sensitive mechanisms have been reported . The effects of clinically safe antioxidants in the regulation of adhesion molecule expression in human endothelial cells ( ECV ) , and adherence of human Jurkat T cells to ECV cells were investigated . The thiol antioxidant , alpha - lipoate , at clinically relevant doses down - regulated phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) - induced adhesion molecule expression and cell - cell adhesion . Inhibition of PMA - induced ICAM - 1 and VCAM - 1 expression as well as PMA - induced adhesion of Jurkat T - cells to ECV cells by alpha - lipoate was dose dependent ( 50 - 250 microM ) . The effect was significant for ICAM - 1 ( p < . 01 ) and VCAM - 1 ( p < . 01 ) expression in cells pretreated with 100 microM alpha - lipoate compared to PMA - activated untreated cells . Inhibition of PMA - induced adhesion molecule expression and cell - cell adhesion was more pronounced when a combination of antioxidants , alpha - lipoate and alpha - tocopherol , were used compared to the use of either of these antioxidant alone . The regulation of adhesion molecule expression and function by low concentration of antioxidants investigated does not appear to be NF - kappaB regulated or transcription dependent because no change in the mRNA response was observed . Protein kinase C ( PKC ) has been suggested to regulate PMA - induced adhesion molecule expression by post - transcriptional stabilization of adhesion molecule mRNA . Alpha - lipoate pretreatment did not influence the response of PKC activity to PMA . Oxidants are known to be involved in the regulation of cell adhesion processes . Treatment of ECV cells with PMA induced generation of intracellular oxidants . Alpha - lipoate ( 100 or 250 microM ) treatment decreased PMA - induced generation of intracellular oxidants . The inhibitory effect of low concentration of alpha - lipaote alone or in combination with alpha - tocopherol on agonist - induced adhesion processes observed in this study may be of potential therapeutic value . Binding of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 to CD4 and CXCR4 receptors differentially regulates expression of inflammatory genes and activates the MEK / ERK signaling pathway . We have previously shown that binding of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) virions to CD4 receptors stimulates association of Lck with Raf - 1 and results in the activation of Raf - 1 kinase in a Ras - independent manner . In the present study , we demonstrate that HIV - 1 envelope glycoproteins of both T - cell - tropic and macrophagetropic strains rapidly activate the ERK / mitogen - activated protein ( MAP ) kinase pathway and the binding of nuclear transcription factors ( AP - 1 , NF - kappaB , and C / EBP ) and stimulate expression of cytokine and chemokine genes . The activation of this signaling pathway requires functional CD4 receptors and is independent of binding to CXCR4 . Binding of the natural ligand stromal cell - derived factor 1 ( SDF - 1 ) to CXCR4 , which inhibits entry of T - cell - tropic HIV - 1 , activates also the ERK / MAP kinase pathway . However , SDF - 1 did not affect the CD4 - mediated expression of cytokine and chemokine genes . These results provide firm molecular evidence that binding of HIV - 1 envelope glycoproteins to CD4 receptor initiates a signaling pathway ( s ) independent of the binding to the chemokine receptor that leads to the aberrant expression of inflammatory genes and may contribute significantly to HIV - 1 replication as well as to deregulation of the immune system . Antigen receptor signaling induces MAP kinase - mediated phosphorylation and degradation of the BCL - 6 transcription factor . The bcl - 6 proto - oncogene encodes a POZ / zinc finger transcriptional repressor expressed in germinal center ( GC ) B and T cells and required for GC formation and antibody affinity maturation . Deregulation of bcl - 6 expression by chromosomal rearrangements and point mutations of the bcl - 6 promoter region are implicated in the pathogenesis of B - cell lymphoma . The signals regulating bcl - 6 expression are not known . Here we show that antigen receptor activation leads to BCL - 6 phosphorylation by mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) . Phosphorylation , in turn , targets BCL - 6 for rapid degradation by the ubiquitin / proteasome pathway . These findings indicate that BCL - 6 expression is directly controlled by the antigen receptor via MAPK activation . This signaling pathway may be crucial for the control of B - cell differentiation and antibody response and has implications for the regulation of other POZ / zinc finger transcription factors in other tissues . Glucocorticoid receptors are differentially expressed in the cells and tissues of the immune system . Cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) binding studies on immune tissues demonstrate that the thymus exhibits three to four times higher levels of GR protein than the spleen . High levels of GR are consistent with the exquisite sensitivity of the thymus to glucocorticoid exposure . Nevertheless , whole cell binding studies reveal similar levels of GR in immature thymic T lymphocytes and more mature , splenic T lymphocytes . Moreover , whole cell binding techniques indicate that neutrophils ( which represent roughly 30 % of splenic leukocytes ) exhibit higher GR than both T and B lymphocytes , further contradicting results from cytosolic binding studies . To address these inconsistencies , GR protein was assessed in immune cells and tissues using cytosolic radioligand binding . Western blot analysis , and immunocytochemistry . Consistent with previous cytosolic receptor binding studies on immune tissue homogenates , thymic T cells were found to have higher levels of GR than T cells isolated from the spleen . In addition , neutrophils were found to have fewer GR than lymphocytes and monocytes . These results indicate a meaningful relationship between receptor expression and known sensitivity to glucocorticoids . Functional replacement of the mouse E2A gene with a human HEB cDNA . The mammalian E2A , HEB , and E2 - 2 genes encode a unique class of basic helix - loop - helix ( bHLH ) transcription factors that are evolutionarily conserved and essential for embryonic and postnatal development . While the structural and functional similarities among the gene products are well demonstrated , it is not clear why deletion of E2A , but not HEB or E2 - 2 , leads to a complete arrest in B - lymphocyte development . To understand the molecular basis of the functional specificity between E2A and HEB / E2 - 2 in mammalian development , we generated and tested a panel of E2A knockin mutations including subtle mutations in the E12 and E47 exons and substitution of both E12 and E47 exons with a human HEB cDNA . We find that the alternatively spliced E12 and E47 bHLH proteins of the E2A gene play similar and additive roles in supporting B lymphopoiesis . Further , we find that HEB driven by the endogenous E2A promoter can functionally replace E2A in supporting B - cell commitment and differentiation toward completion . Finally , the postnatal lethality associated with E2A disruption is fully rescued by the addition of HEB . This study suggests that the functional divergence among E12 , E47 , and HEB in different cell types is partially defined by the context of gene expression . Biased dependency of CD80 versus CD86 in the induction of transcription factors regulating the human IL - 2 promoter . In addition to the signals obtained by ligation of the TCR , T cells need additional , co - stimulatory signals to be activated . One such co - stimulatory signal is delivered when CD28 on T cells binds to CD80 or CD86 on antigen - presenting cells ( APC ) . In the present study , we analyzed the ability of CD80 and CD86 to co - stimulate human T cells activated by superantigen . Using the Raji B cell lymphoma , which express similar levels of CD80 and CD86 , it was found that T cell proliferation was mainly co - stimulated by CD80 . To further characterize the consequences of this biased co - stimulatory dependency , we employed a well - defined system of transfected CHO cells expressing human MHC class II together with CD80 , CD86 or CD80 and CD86 . Proliferation of freshly prepared CD4 + T cells required the presence of either CD80 or CD86 . However , IL - 2 production reached only suboptimal levels in the presence of CD86 but optimal levels with CD80 . To analyze IL - 2 transcriptional activity in CD80 and CD86 co - stimulated T cells we used Jurkat T cells transfected with luciferase reporter gene constructs . CD80 induced higher levels of IL - 2 promoter - enhancer activity compared to CD86 . Furthermore , the activity of transcription factors regulating the IL - 2 promoter - enhancer region including activation protein - 1 , CD28 response element and nuclear factor kappaB were 4 - 8 times higher after CD80 compared to CD86 ligation . Our results suggest that the eventual appearance of CD80 on recently activated CD86 + APC is important for the superinduction of IL - 2 production and to support vigorous T cell proliferation . Duplication of the DR3 gene on human chromosome 1p36 and its deletion in human neuroblastoma . The human DR3 gene , whose product is also known as Wsl - 1 / APO - 3 / TRAMP / LARD , encodes a tumor necrosis factor - related receptor that is expressed primarily on the surface of thymocytes and lymphocytes . DR3 is capable of inducing both NF - kappa B activation and apoptosis when overexpressed in mammalian cells , although its ligand has not yet been identified . We report here that the DR3 gene locus is tandemly duplicated on human chromosome band 1p36 . 2 - p36 . 3 and that these genes are hemizygously deleted and / or translocated to another chromosome in neuroblastoma ( NB ) cell lines with amplified MYCN . Duplication of at least a portion of the DR3 gene , including the extracellular and transmembrane regions but not the cytoplasmic domain , was demonstrated by both fluorescence in situ hybridization and genomic Southern blotting . In most NB cell lines , both the DR3 and the DR3L sequences are simultaneously deleted and / or translocated to another chromosome . Finally , DR3 / Wsl - 1 protein expression is quite variable among these NB cell lines , with very low or undetectable levels in 7 of 17 NB cell lines Differential protection of normal and malignant human myeloid progenitors ( CFU - GM ) from Ara - C toxicity using cycloheximide . Cycloheximide , a reversible protein synthesis inhibitor , is thought to block DNA replication in normal cells by preventing synthesis of a labile protein . In animal systems , cycloheximide protects normal cells from cytotoxic S - phase specific agents , such as cytosine arabinoside ( Ara - C ) . Malignant cells appear not to be susceptible to cycloheximide - induced cycle arrest and , subsequently , may not be protected from Ara - C cytotoxicity . The effect of cycloheximide on granulocyte / macrophage progenitors ( CFU - GM ) after in vitro Ara - C exposure was examined using normal human bone marrow , malignant progenitors from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) , and clonogenic cells from the human acute nonlymphocytic leukemia cell lines HL - 60 and KG - 1 . Mononuclear or clonogenic cells were incubated for one hour with cycloheximide , followed by the addition , for three or 17 hours , of Ara - C before being plated in a methylcellulose culture system . CFU - GM survival was significantly increase if normal cells were treated with cycloheximide before Ara - C exposure . Similar cycloheximide pretreatment of CML progenitors and clonogenic HL - 60 and KG - 1 cells failed to protect CFU - GM from Ara - C - induced cytotoxicity . Primary cortisol resistance accompanied by a reduction in glucocorticoid receptors in two members of the same family . This report describes studies of a man suspected of having primary cortisol resistance . This conclusion is based on his high plasma cortisol levels and high 24 - h urinary 17 - hydroxycorticosteroi and cortisol excretion , plus the fact that he had no manifestations of Cushing ' s syndrome . Among family members tested , his mother also had hypercortisolemia . Both mother and son had high levels of unbound plasma cortisol , but their plasma ACTH concentrations were within the normal range . Both were partially resistant to dexamethasone adrenal suppression , and both had mild hypertension without hypokalemia . To study this apparent end - organ resistance to cortisol , we examined the glucocorticoid receptors in peripheral mononuclear cells . Using whole cell assays , glucocorticoid receptors in both patients were found to have reduced total binding capacity . We conclude that these two patients , members of the same family , have primary cortisol resistance accompanied by a reduced number of glucocorticoid receptors . [ Glucocorticoid receptors and response to polychemotherapy in acute lymphatic leukemia ] Glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) levels were quantified in leukemic blasts from peripheral blood of 86 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia . The subsequent achievement of complete remission after combination chemotherapy was correlated with high receptor levels . Forty - seven of 50 patients with leukemic cells containing more than 6 , 000 receptor sites and 22 of 36 patients with cells containing less than 6 , 000 receptor sites achieved remission . The study of glucocorticoid receptors in leukemic cells may predict response to combination chemotherapy in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia . Specific uptake of 1 , 25 - dihydroxycholecalcif by human chronic myeloid leukemia cells . We have examined mononuclear cell preparations from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia [ CML ] for binding of and response to 1 , 25 - dihydroxycholecalcif [ 1 , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 ] . Whole cells specifically took up [ 3H ] - 1 , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 with high affinity ( Kd 3 . 6 X 10 ( - 11 ) M ) and low capacity . Subcellular fractionation of labeled cells showed that binding was restricted to cytosols and nuclei . Sucrose gradient centrifugation of cells preincubated with [ 3H ] - 1 , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 revealed a single 3 . 6S peak which was totally displaced with 100 - fold excess nonradioactive hormone . However , we were unable to demonstrate specific binding of 1 , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 by postlabeling standard cytosol preparations . In addition , cytosols prepared from a mixture of CML cells and 1 , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 receptor - positive T47D ( human breast cancer ) cells had less than 10 % of the binding measured in T47D cytosol alone . However , the levels of binding in T47D cytosols were not reduced if the receptors were occupied with [ 3H ] - 1 , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 prior to the addition of the CML cytosols . Thus , CML cells appear to contain both the receptor for 1 , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 and an unknown substance which prevents its detection following the preparation of cytosol . Cells from patients with CML in the chronic phase specifically bound more 1 , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 [ 18 . 0 + / - 3 . 2 ( S . E . ) fmol / 10 ( 7 ) cells ] than did those in acute myeloid transformation [ 7 . 2 + / - 1 . 5 ] or than did cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia [ 2 . 6 + / - 0 . 8 ] . Only cells from the first group of patients responded to the addition of 1 , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 by differentiating along the monocyte - macrophage pathway . We conclude that the differentiation - induction effect of 1 , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 is likely to depend on adequate levels of receptor and that intact cells rather than cytosol preparations should be studied before cells of a particular tissue are designated as receptor negative . Effect of cell cycle position on dexamethasone binding by mouse and human lymphoid cell lines : correlation between an increase in dexamethasone binding during S phase and dexamethasone sensitivity . We determined the effect of cell cycle position on the amount of dexamethasone that was specifically bound by mouse and human lymphoid cell lines . Cell lines that were either sensitive or resistant to growth inhibition by dexamethasone were compared . Exponentially growing cells were separated by centrifugal elutriation into fractions that corresponded to different positions in the cell cycle . The cell cycle phase distribution of each fraction was estimated by flow cytometry and autoradiography . The amount of dexamethasone bound per cell in each fraction was measured by a whole cell binding assay . In three dexamethasone - sensitive cell lines ( two mouse and one human ) , we found that the amount of dexamethasone bound per cell increased 2 - 4 - fold between G1 phase and S phase , and then decreased during G2 / M phase . Results were the same when the amount of dexamethasone bound per milligram of cell protein was measured . Binding affinity was the same during G1 phase and S phase , but the proportion of bound dexamethasone that translocated to the nucleus was greater during S phase . In contrast , we found that the amount of dexamethasone bound per cell by three dexamethasone - resistant cell lines ( two mouse and one human ) did not increase during S phase . Our results indicate that cell cycle changes in dexamethasone binding are not simply related to changes in cell protein or cell volume during the cell cycle . An increase in dexamethasone binding during S phase may be required for dexamethasone to inhibit cell growth , and a failure of dexamethasone binding to increase during S phase might represent a new mechanism of dexamethasone resistance in lymphoid cells . Presence and steroid inducibility of glutamine synthetase in human leukemic cells . Glutamine synthetase ( EC 6 . 3 . 1 . 2 ; GS ) is present in lymphoblasts from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) as well as in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes . In 16 out of 20 ALL patients studied exposure of the cells to physiological concentrations of dexamethasone in vitro increased enzyme activity above the control levels . The increase was specific for glucocorticoid receptor ligands . A direct correlation was found between the magnitude of glucocorticoid - mediated increase of GS activity and the cellular levels of specific glucocorticoid receptors assayed in the same cell specimen . Moreover , the basal levels of the enzyme measured in cells prior to exposure to dexamethasone correlated negatively with receptor density . It is suggested that the presence of steroid - inducible GS in ALL cells may prove to be a marker for functional receptor sites . Binding of progestins to the glucocorticoid receptor . Correlation to their glucocorticoid - like effects on in vitro functions of human mononuclear leukocytes . A number of physiological and synthetic progestins were tested for their ability to compete with [ 3H ] dexamethasone for the binding to the glucocorticoid receptor of human mononuclear leukocytes and their ability to elicit glucocorticoid - like effects on the same cells . As compared to the reference compound dexamethasone ( relative receptor binding affinity defined as 100 % ) , two potent synthetic progestins with a pregnane - type structure , megestrol acetate and medroxyprogesterone acetate , were found to display a considerable binding affinity towards the receptor ( 46 and 42 % , respectively ) . The relative binding affinity of the naturally occurring ligand , cortisol , to the receptor was clearly lower ( 25 % ) . The effective binding of medroxyprogesterone acetate to the glucocorticoid receptor was confirmed by direct binding studies utilizing a tritiated derivative of this steroid . No evidence for the existence of a specific progesterone receptor in human mononuclear leukocytes was obtained as judged by the results of competition experiments where a progesterone receptor - specific ligand [ 3H ] Org 2058 was used . Medroxyprogesterone acetate and megestrol acetate also induced glucocorticoid - like effects on the lymphocyte functions . These included inhibition of the proliferative responses to the T - cell mitogens concanavalin A and phytohaemagglutinin and an enhanced accumulation of immunoglobulin secreting cells in pokeweed mitogen - stimulated cultures . The progestin effect appears to be mediated through a radiosensitive ( suppressor ) subpopulation of T lymphocytes . In contrast , the synthetic progestins related structurally to 19 - nortestosterone , norethisterone and d - norgestrel , were virtually devoid of binding affinity towards the glucocorticoid receptor nor did they measurably influence the in vitro lymphocyte functions . These studies demonstrate that certain progestins in common clinical use probably possess inherent glucocorticoid activity and suggest that side effects attributable to this character ( e . g . suppression of the pituitary - adrenal axis ) might be expected when these compounds are used in pharmacological doses . Metabolic and ultrastructural aspects of the in vitro lysis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells by glucocorticoids . Human chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) cells like prothymocytes and immunoactivated T - lymphocytes are readily lysed in vitro by pharmacological concentrations of glucocorticoids such as cortisol , whereas peripheral blood lymphocytes and thymocytes are unaffected by the hormone . In this study , metabolic and ultrastructural aspects of the cortisol - induced killing process of CLL cells are recorded . In vitro lysis was found to be temperature dependent and was detected only after 6 to 8 hr incubation with cortisol by means of the trypan blue exclusion test . However , 30 min of incubation with cortisol at either 37 degrees or 4 degrees followed by the removal of the hormone was still sufficient to induce the lytic process . Ultrastructural studies demonstrated sequential changes in the cytoplasm , including swelling of mitochondria and cytoplasmic decompartmentalizati , followed by loss of surface microvilli with the appearance of ` ` holes ' ' in the cell membrane , and subsequent condensation of nuclear chromatin . The large holes in the membrane appearing after 6 hr of incubation with the hormone may be the cause for the penetration of the viable stain into the dead cells , as seen by light microscopy . Addition of metabolic inhibitors including actinomycin D , puromycin , and cycloheximide following administration of cortisol resulted in inhibition of the cell lysis . An excess of an antagonist such as cortexolone was found to inhibit the cortisol - induced cytolysis of the CLL cells . It is suggested that the glucocorticoid - induced lysis of human CLL cells is similar to the phenomenon observed in rat or murine lymphocytes and is mediated by interaction of the steroid molecule with the cytoplasmic receptor . The resulting complex appears to activate specific gene ( s ) the products of which eventually cause cytolysis . Glucocorticoid receptors in lymphoid tumors . There is a range of levels of glucocorticoid receptor numbers seen in the various subclasses of acute lymphatic leukemia ( ALL ) . This variability can not be explained by the known correlation between active cell proliferation and an increase in the number of receptors , since the tumors with the highest growth fraction ( i . e . , Burkitt ' s lymphoma and T - cell leukemia ) tend to have lower average receptor numbers than do tumors with lower growth fractions such as common ALL . All clinical specimens from patients with lymphatic leukemia have some measurable level of glucocorticoid receptors ; therefore , the resistance seen in vivo can not be explained by the lack of receptors . However , there has been a positive correlation , in our hands , with receptor level and prognosis . On the basis of in vitro models , it is proposed that perhaps the high receptor cell lines ( i . e . , common ALL of childhood ) have relative stability of their genetic material making glucocorticoid - resistant mutations less likely to occur in patients with these cells than in low - receptor cell lines ( i . e . , T - cell leukemia ) . This greater genetic variability in the low - receptor lines could account for the earlier emergence of clinical glucocorticoid resistance in these patients . [ Tumor histology and steroid receptors in breast carcinoma ] In Specimens of 115 patients with breast cancer 4 tumorparameters ( tumorsize , tumorboder , nucleargrade , lymphocytic stromal reaction ) 3 features of regional lymphnodes ( sinushistiocytosis , T - cellreaction , lymphnode metastases ) and estrogen and progesteron receptors were determined . A strong sinushistiocytosis and T - cellreaction could be verified mainly in metastases in free lymphnodes . The steroid receptor content does not correlate with histological parameters Aldosterone - receptor deficiency in pseudohypoaldosteron . Pseudohypoaldosteron , a syndrome characterized by salt wasting and failure to thrive , usually presents in infancy as high urinary levels of sodium despite hyponatremia , hyperkalemia , hyperreninemia , and elevated aldosterone levels . We have investigated this syndrome for the possibility of abnormal Type I or ` ` mineralocorticoid - like ' ' receptors , which have intrinsic steroid specificity indistinguishable from that of renal mineralocorticoid receptors and are found in many tissues and cells , including mononuclear leukocytes . We have studied three patients with pseudohypoaldosteron : the 28 - year - old index case in Melbourne ( Patient 1 ) and two siblings in Munich , eight and two years of age ( Patients 2 and 3 ) ; clinically , Patient 3 had a less severe case than his sister . Percoll - separated control monocytes bound [ 3H ] aldosterone with high affinity ( Kd approximately 3 nM ) and limited capacity ( 150 to 600 sites per cell ) . On repeated examination , no [ 3H ] aldosterone binding was found in monocytes from Patients 1 and 2 ; in Patient 3 , the levels were 62 sites per cell , more than 2 S . D . below those of the control . Levels in the parents of the Munich patients ( first cousins ) were normal . It appears that pseudohypoaldosteron is caused by a Type I receptor defect , that the defect may be complete or partial , that transmission may be autosomal recessive , and that the study of patients with pseudohypoaldosteron may indicate physiologic roles for Type I receptors in nonepithelial tissues . Glucocorticoid inhibition of urokinase - like plasminogen activators in cultured human lymphoblasts . Two human lymphoblast cell lines , LICR - LON - HMy2 ( HMy2 cells ) and GM4672A cells , are moderately growth inhibited by dexamethasone ( 1 , 4 - pregnadien - 9 - fluoro - 16 alpha - methyl - 11 beta , 17 alpha , 21 - triol - 3 , 20 - dione ) ( Dex ) . Both cell types secrete a urokinase ( UK ) - like plasminogen activator ( PA ) . Treatment of both HMy2 and GM4672A cells with Dex for 1 - 4 days inhibits extracellular PA activity in a concentration - dependent manner , being half - maximal at approximately 1 X 10 ( - 9 ) M . Inhibition of PA in both cell types is specific for active glucocorticoids , and this specificity parallels the ability of various steroids to bind to glucocorticoid receptors . HMy2 cell PA is fully suppressible by Dex , whereas up to one third of the activator expressed by GM4672A cells is resistant to glucocorticoid inhibition . Mixing experiments using a UK standard and conditioned media from Dex - treated cells suggest an absence of glucocorticoid - inducible inhibitors to UK or plasmin in both cell types . However , conditioned media from Dex - treated GM4672A cells inhibits a portion of the homologous cellular activator in conditioned media from control GM4672A cells . Thus , low levels of glucocorticoid - inducible inhibitors may contribute to , but can not fully account for , Dex inhibition of GM4672A PA activity . Glucocorticoid - inducible inhibitors in HMy2 cells are either totally absent or are present at undetectable levels . Thus , regulation of UK - like PAs in HMy2 and GM4672A cells differs with respect to the extent to which glucocorticoids inhibit constitutively expressed activator levels , as well as the possible contribution of glucocorticoid - inducible inhibitors to the regulatory process in GM4672A cells . Characterization of aldosterone binding sites in circulating human mononuclear leukocytes . Aldosterone binding sites in human mononuclear leukocytes were characterized after separation of cells from blood by a Percoll gradient . After washing and resuspension in RPMI - 1640 medium , cells were incubated at 37 degrees C for 1 h with different concentrations of [ 3H ] aldosterone plus a 100 - fold concentration of RU - 26988 ( 11 alpha , 17 alpha - dihydroxy - 17 beta - propynylandrost - 1 , 4 , 6 - trien - 3 - one ) , with or without an excess of unlabeled aldosterone . Aldosterone binds to a single class of receptors with an affinity of 2 . 7 + / - 0 . 5 nM ( means + / - SD , n = 14 ) and a capacity of 290 + / - 108 sites / cell ( n = 14 ) . The specificity data show a hierarchy of affinity of desoxycorticosterone = corticosterone = aldosterone greater than hydrocortisone greater than dexamethasone . The results indicate that mononuclear leukocytes could be useful for studying the physiological significance of these mineralocorticoid receptors and their regulation in humans . Mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors in circulating mononuclear leukocytes of patients with primary hyperaldosteronism . Mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors were measured in circulating mononuclear leukocytes in 5 patients affected by Conn ' s syndrome ( 3 cases of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and 2 cases of adenoma plus unilateral hyperplasia ) . The number of the binding sites per cell resulted significantly lower ( 189 + / - 114 , mean + / - SD ) , as compared with the normal controls ( 298 + / - 105 ) . The affinity of aldosterone for the receptor was found to be not different than that of healthy control subjects . The capacity and the affinity of dexamethasone for glucocorticoid receptors ranged in the normal values . These data suggest a possible down - regulation of mineralocorticoid receptors in humans . Short - term and long - term effects of estrogen on lymphoid tissues and lymphoid cells with some remarks on the significance for carcinogenesis . Estrogens have long been thought to play a role in regulating the immune system . The difference in some types of immune responses between males and females is well - known , as is the pronounced thymic involution induced by exogenous estrogens . Estrogens stimulate some aspects of macrophage activity and , depending on dose and mitogen , inhibit or stimulate lymphocyte proliferative response in vitro . Another example is the estrogen effect on the delayed type hypersensitivity response . A broad review is given of such estrogen effects on lymphoid tissue and immune response . Most of the studies published so far are phenomenological . However , the recent description of estrogen receptors in the thymus and in some lymphocyte subpopulations , as well as a deeper understanding of regulating factors in the immune system , open the possibility of a more detailed understanding of the estrogen mechanism of interference . Estrogen effects in adults are reversible . After treating neonatal mice with the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol ( DES ) , disturbances are induced in lymphocyte populations and lymphocyte functions which are permanent and irreversible . Lymphocytes from adult , neonatally DES - treated female mice have a reduced mitogen response to ConA and LPS ( T and B cell mitogen ) and the delayed type hypersensitivity response is depressed . A detailed analysis demonstrated a decreased T helper cell population . The activity of Natural Killer cells is permanently reduced and this functional impairment is related to a decreased number of these cells , in turn determined at the bone marrow level . The same animals have an increased sensitivity to chemical carcinogens ( methylcholanthrene ) and they spontaneously develop epithelial changes in the uterine cervix which morphologically are similar to adenocarcinoma . The association between estrogen - associated malignancy and estrogen effects in lymphocyte functions deserves further study . Drugs affecting the hormonal receptors of normal and leukaemic peripheral leucocytes . The authors investigated the behaviour of steroid hormone uptake in leukaemic cells ( CML , CLL , AML , ALL ) , in basal conditions and after incubation with drugs which modify the cellular concentration of cAMP , PGE and PGF . The results demonstrated the presence in leukaemic cells of an alteration in the incorporation of steroid hormones . This alteration was scarcely modified by incubation with theophylline , which increases cellular concentration of cAMP . On the other hand , it was moderately counteracted by thioproline and was evidently inhibited by flurbiprofen , which also reduced cellular concentrations of prostaglandins , particularly PGE2 , with the exception of PGF2 which showed a poor response . Differences were observed in the behavior of hormonal uptake of CML , in contrast to that of AML , CLL and ALL peripheral leucocytes . Human breast cancer and impaired NK cell function . Recent advances in tumor immunology have led to the discovery of a new lymphoid cell with unique antitumor activity . Natural killer ( NK ) cells form an antitumor surveillance system and appear to be vital in preventing tumor growth and metastasis in animal models . We studied NK activity in patients with benign and malignant breast disease , using a chromium - 51 release microtiter cytotoxicity assay with K562 cells as targets . Compared with benign controls , patients with malignancies had significantly depressed NK - mediated lysis ( P less than 0 . 01 ) . Furthermore , lysis in those with advanced disease ( stages II , III , and IV ) was significantly less than in those with limited disease ( stage I ) ( P less than 0 . 01 ) . NK activity was not correlated to estrogen or progesterone receptor states . Positive correlation of a depressed natural killer activity with the extent of tumor spread supports the concept of an NK cell immune surveillance system in breast cancer and emphasizes its importance in this malignancy . Immunosuppressive effect of serum progesterone during pregnancy depends on the progesterone binding capacity of the lymphocytes . Cytotoxic activity and progesterone binding capacity of the lymphocytes , together with serum progesterone concentrations , were determined in women with normal pregnancy or with a clinical diagnosis of threatened abortion or threatened premature labour . The lymphocytes of women with threatened abortion or threatened premature labour showed significantly higher cytotoxic activity ( P less than 0 . 001 ) and significantly lower progesterone binding capacity ( P less than 0 . 001 ) than did lymphocytes obtained from the healthy pregnant women . Significant inverse correlation was found between progesterone binding capacity and cytotoxic activity of the lymphocytes ( P less than 0 . 001 ) , but the progesterone concentration of the pregnancy serum appeared to have no influence on the other two parameters . The findings indicate that intact progesterone binding capacity of the lymphocytes is an essential factor for the manifestation of the blocking effect exerted by pregnancy serum on lymphocyte cytotoxicity in vitro . Serum sex steroid and peptide hormone concentrations , and endometrial estrogen and progestin receptor levels during administration of human leukocyte interferon . Five normally cycling healthy women were given daily subcutaneous injections of human leukocyte interferon ( 3 X 10 ( 6 ) units / day ) from the 3rd through 23rd day of the menstrual cycle , and serum steroid and peptide hormone concentrations monitored at 3 - day intervals during the treatment and the preceding control cycle . Concentrations of cytosol and nuclear estrogen receptors ( ERC and ERN , respectively ) and progestin receptors ( PRC and PRN ) were also measured from endometrial biopsies taken on the 24th day of the control and treatment cycle . In addition , an extensive monitoring of clinical chemical and hematological tests from the blood samples were performed . Serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations were significantly decreased during the treatment cycle , suggesting that interferon interacts in vivo with the function of both FSH and LH . No significant changes were observed in the serum peptide hormone concentrations measured ( FSH , LH , prolactin , insulin , growth hormone and TSH ) ; neither were the levels of endometrial ERC , ERN , PRC and PRN affected by interferon administration . As expected , interferon administration resulted in decreased leukocyte counts . Moreover , an increasing tendency in the activities of serum alkaline phosphatase and gamma - glutamyltransferase during the interferon therapy shows that interferon may slightly interfere with the liver function . These results suggest that one of the mechanisms by which interferon treatment may affect the growth of hormone - dependent neoplasms could be the interaction with production and / or function of circulating hormonal compounds . [ Glucocorticoid receptor level in the blood leukocytes in different acute diseases ] Content of glucocorticoid receptors in cytosol of blood leukocytes , concentration of cortisol and amount of leukocytes in blood were studied in 20 patients with acute impairments within the second day of the disease . Content of receptors in cytosol of blood leukocytes was studied using 3H - triamcinolone acetonide . Distinct increase in amount of the leukocyte glucocorticoid receptors was found in patients with poisoning by dichlorethane and hypnotic drugs under conditions of acute myocardial infarction . In acute pancreatitis content of the leukocyte receptors was not altered as compared with controls . Concentration of endogenous cortisol was increased in blood of all the patients , except of the cases of acetate intoxication . Reverse correlation was observed between concentration of cortisol in blood and content of glucocorticoid receptors in leukocytes . But in the patients with acute pancreatitis the decrease in content of leukocyte glucocorticoid receptors was not observed although there was an increase in cortisol concentration in blood . The role of glucocorticoid receptors in immunological processes under conditions of purulent complications and possibility to regulate the metabolism in leukocytes Therapeutic concentrations of glucocorticoids suppress the antimicrobial activity of human macrophages without impairing their responsiveness to gamma interferon . By exposing human blood - derived macrophages and alveolar macrophages in vitro to dexamethasone , we showed in these studies that glucocorticoids markedly suppress the antimicrobial activity of macrophages but not macrophage activation by lymphokines . As little as 2 . 5 X 10 ( - 8 ) mol / liter of dexamethasone prevented macrophages from inhibiting germination of Aspergillus spores or from eliminating ingested bacteria such as Listeria , Nocardia , or Salmonella . Damage to macrophage function was inhibited by progesterone and appeared to be receptor - mediated . In accordance with in vivo observations , dexamethasone required 24 - 36 h to suppress antimicrobial activity . While glucocorticoids interfered with base - line activity of macrophages , dexamethasone concentrations comparable to drug levels in patients had no effect on macrophage activation . Proliferating lymphocytes and gamma - interferon thus increased the antimicrobial activity of phagocytes exposed to glucocorticoids over that of control cells . Macrophage activation and correction of the dexamethasone effect by gamma - interferon , however , was dependent on the pathogen . The lymphokine enhanced the antimicrobial activity of dexamethasone - treated macrophages against Listeria and Salmonella but not against Aspergillus or Nocardia . Dexamethasone - induced damage to the antimicrobial activity of human macrophages in vitro parallels observations that glucocorticoids render laboratory animals susceptible to listeriosis and aspergillosis by damaging resident macrophages . Suppression of macrophage antimicrobial activity should thus be considered when treating patients with glucocorticoids ; its prevention by gamma - interferon might be beneficial for some but not all pathogens . Interleukin 2 receptor ( Tac antigen ) expression in HTLV - I - associated adult T - cell leukemia . Interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) is a lymphokine synthesized by some T - cells following activation . Resting T - cells do not express IL - 2 receptors , but receptors are rapidly expressed on T - cells following interaction of antigens , mitogens , or monoclonal antibodies with the antigen - specific T - cell receptor complex . Using anti - Tac , a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the IL - 2 receptor , the receptor has been purified and shown to be a Mr 33 , 000 peptide that is posttranslationally glycosylated to a Mr 55 , 000 mature form . Normal resting T - cells and most leukemic T - cell populations do not express IL - 2 receptors ; however , the leukemic cells of the 11 patients examined who had human T - cell lymphotropic virus - associated adult T - cell leukemia expressed the Tac antigen . In human T - cell lymphotropic virus - I infected cells , the Mr 42 , 000 long open reading frame protein encoded in part by the pX region of this virus may act as a transacting transcriptional activator that induces IL - 2 receptor gene transcription , thus providing an explanation for the constant association of IL - 2 receptor expression with adult T - cell lymphotropic virus - I infection of lymphoid cells . The constant expression of large numbers of IL - 2 receptors which may be aberrant may play a role in the uncontrolled growth of adult T - cell leukemia cells . Two patients with Tac - positive adult T - cell leukemia have been treated with the anti - Tac . One of the patients had 6 - and 3 - mo remissions of his leukemia following two courses of therapy with this monoclonal antibody directed toward this growth factor receptor . Lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptor binding in depressed patients with hypercortisolemia . Despite elevated levels of serum and urinary cortisol , patients with depressive illness manifest none of the clinical stigmata of glucocorticoid excess . This hypercortisolemia in the absence of clinical effects suggests a state of hormone resistance and could be mediated by alterations in the glucocorticoid receptor . Earlier studies have shown that small doses of glucocorticoids cause a decrease in glucocorticoid receptor binding in normal human lymphocytes . White cells from depressed patients with significant hypercortisolemia would be expected to show a similar change in receptor concentration if peripheral tissues are adequately exposed to and sensitive to the hormone . In this study we compared the binding of [ 3H ] dexamethasone to lymphocytes from normal subjects and depressed patients with hypercortisolemia . Lymphocytes from normal subjects had a mean receptor concentration of 10 . 2 + / - 0 . 66 fm / 10 ( 6 ) cells ( S . E . M . ) and a dissociation constant of 4 . 8 + / - 0 . 47 nM . Lymphocytes from depressed patients with abnormal 0800 h serum cortisol after dexamethasone had a mean receptor concentration of 8 . 8 + / - 0 . 75 fm / 10 ( 6 ) cells , which was not significantly different from that in lymphocytes from normal subjects or from depressed subjects with normal post - dexamethasone cortisol levels ( 9 . 4 + / - 0 . 95 fm / 10 ( 6 ) cells ) . Lymphocytes from depressed patients with elevated urinary free cortisol excretion ( UFC ) also had normal receptor concentration and binding affinity for dexamethasone . The lack of a change in lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptor concentration in the presence of cortisol excess suggests the possibility that hypercortisolemia in depressive illness represents a state of peripheral glucocorticoid resistance . Structure and regulation of the glucocorticoid hormone receptor . The glucocorticoid receptor is an intracellular protein which possesses three distinct domains , one that binds agonist and antagonist steroids , one that binds DNA , and one that binds anti - receptor antibodies and is required for glucocorticoid modulation of gene expression . In intact cells , receptor number , affinity and activity can change in response to factors that bind to the receptor , or that act indirectly through ill - defined mechanisms which may include resumption or arrest of cell cycling and variations in intracellular calcium ion concentrations . Some of these factors appear to exert their effect by controlling critical receptor properties such as ATP - dependent phosphorylation , integrity of thiol groups , and exposure of key amino acid residues . Glucocorticoid agonists promote the ' transformation ' of the receptor into the DNA - binding state , which is competent for modulating gene expression . Glucocorticoid antagonists are steroids that interact with the receptor but either fail to produce a stable complex or produce a stable but inefficient complex . Although substituent groups that confer agonist or antagonist activity to the steroid have been identified , the molecular determinants of this difference at the receptor level remain unknown . Most in vitro and in vivo data on receptor regulation can be accommodated by postulating the existence of an intracellular cycle that involves five states of the receptor . The active free receptor is phosphorylated , reduced , and presumably oligomeric ( state A ) . Following binding of an agonist ( state B ) , it can become transformed by dissociation into its subunits and dephosphorylation ( state C ) . The transformed receptor then interacts with chromatin ( state D ) . Dissociation of the steroid and oxidation of receptor thiol group ( s ) lead to the inactive receptor form ( state E ) . Reduction and rephosphorylation of the receptor enable it to bind steroids again so that the cycle is closed . Thermodynamics of steroid binding to the human glucocorticoid receptor . The thermodynamics of the interaction of glucocorticoids with their receptor were studied in cytosol from human lymphoblastoid cells . The rate and affinity constants of dexamethasone and cortisol between 0 degree and 25 degrees C were calculated by curve - fitting from time - course and equilibrium kinetics . The data were consistent with a simple reversible bimolecular interaction . Arrhenius and Va n ' t Hoff plots were curvilinear for both steroids . At equilibrium , the solution for the equation delta G = delta H - T X delta S ( eqn . 1 ) was ( in kJ X mol - 1 ) - 47 = 36 - 83 ( dexamethasone ) and - 42 = - 9 - 33 ( cortisol ) at 0 degree C . Enthalpy and entropy changes decreased quasi - linearly with temperature such that , at 25 degrees C , the respective values were - 50 = - 75 + 25 and - 43 = - 48 + 5 . Thus , for both steroids , the interaction was entropy - driven at low temperature and became entirely enthalpy - driven at 20 degrees C . Thermodynamic values for the transition state were calculated from the rate constants . For the forward reaction , eqn . ( 1 ) gave 45 = 84 - 39 ( dexamethasone ) and 46 = 60 - 14 ( cortisol ) at 0 degree C , and 44 = 24 + 20 ( dexamethasone ) and 46 = 28 + 18 ( cortisol ) at 25 degrees C . These data fit quite well with a two - step model [ Ross & Subramanian ( 1981 ) Biochemistry 20 , 3096 - 3102 ] proposed for ligand - protein interactions , which involves a partial immobilization of the reacting species governed by hydrophobic forces , followed by stabilization of the complex by short - range interactions . On the basis of this model , an analysis of the transition - state thermodynamics led to the conclusion that no more than half of the steroid molecular area is engaged in the binding process . Cell cycle - related changes in number of T - lymphocyte receptors for glucocorticoids and insulin . Enriched human peripheral T - lymphocytes were stimulated with PHA and examined for variations in insulin and glucocorticoid ( dexamethasone ) receptor numbers during the early phases of the cell cycle . Cells in G0 , G1a and G1b phases , where the G1a - G1b transition is an Interleukin 2 dependent event , were quantitated by flow cytometry . Few but significant numbers of glucocorticoid receptors ( 2700 / cell ) and no insulin receptors ( - 1 / cell ) were found in the resting ( G0 ) phase . As cells entered the G1a phase the specific binding of dexamethasone increased and of insulin took place . Although the specific binding further increased as T - cells entered the G1b phase ( as measured at 44 h of incubation and using hydroxyurea - treated cells ) , the major changes in the specific binding of dexamethasone took place during the period 16 - 20 h after stimulation . Based on these findings , it is concluded that both receptor types ( cell membrane and cytoplasmic receptors ) are being formed and increased at G1 phase prior to cell proliferation , indicating the importance of G1 phase in immunoregulation . Glucocorticoid receptors and cortico - sensitivity in a human clonal monocytic cell line , CM - SM . CM - SM is a clonal line of human precursor mononuclear phagocytes inducible to macrophage differentiation in response to the tumor promoter phorbol ester 12 - O - tetradecanoyl - phorbol - 13 - acetate ( TPA ) . Untreated CM - SM cells contain single class , high - affinity ( KD = 4 . 0 X 10 ( - 9 ) M ) glucocorticoid - specific receptor sites ( approximately 60 , 000 per cell ) , as measured by a whole cell assay , at 37 degrees C , using [ 3H ] triamcinolone acetonide ( TA ) . Exposure of CM - SM to dexamethasone ( DEX ) produced a progressive , dose - and time - related series of changes in CM - SM cell growth , saturation density , morphology , and functional properties , with half - maximal effects at about 10 ( - 9 ) M for DEX . TA - receptor sites rapidly decreased ( about 70 % ) after DEX treatment , without any apparent change in steroid specificity and affinity . After 5 days in culture with a saturating concentration ( 3 . 6 X 10 ( - 8 ) M ) of hormone , the cells reached a saturation density of about 9 . 0 X 10 ( 6 ) viable cells / ml ( about 4 . 0 X 10 ( 6 ) viable cells / ml in the controls ) , while the modal volume of the resulting cell population was approximately 60 % , as compared to the volume of untreated cells . DEX - treated cells appeared less differentiated than controls , as assessed by combined morphologic , antigenic , and cytoenzymatic analyses . DEX almost completely inhibited TPA activation of the following macrophage functions : adherency to the culture plate , expression of lysosomal enzymes , Fc and C3 receptors , and stimulation of phagocytosis . After removal of DEX , the cells , within a few passages , returned to a state apparently identical to the untreated controls and could be induced to macrophage differentiation in response to TPA . Acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children : current status , controversies , and future perspective . Disease - free survival ( DFS ) in childhood ALL is 60 % , and survival in good , average , and poor prognostic groups defined by initial WBC and age is 90 , 60 , and 45 % , respectively . Additional immunological , morphological , biochemical , cytokinetic , and cytogenetic factors have been identified , illustrating the heterogeneity of ALL and its derivation from malignant clones at various stages of differentiation and with varying rates of proliferation . Of biologic importance , these factors may refine further the characteristic features of clinically - determined prognostic groups . Multivariate analysis of large prospective trials with homogeneous therapy will be required to determine the independent prognostic importance of these factors . Current treatment strategies in ALL include ( 1 ) tailoring therapy and its intensity to prognostic groups ; ( 2 ) multiple - drug combinations in induction ; ( 3 ) early use of intrathecal ( IT ) methotrexate ( MTX ) ; ( 4 ) CNS prophylaxis with IT MTX alone in good prognosis patients and combined cranial radiation ( CXRT ) , 1800 rads plus IT MTX , in average and poor prognosis patients . Current studies show a CNS relapse rate of 5 % in all prognostic groups . Late neuropsychological defects caused by cranial XRT and IT MTX have prompted programs designed to reduce the potential late toxicity of CNS prophylaxis . More pronounced in younger children , these abnormalities include decreased IQ , visual - motor incoordination , poor performance in mathematics , and memory dysfunction . Until 1980 , more intensive induction , consolidation , and maintenance therapy had failed to prolong DFS in children with a poor prognosis . In West Germany ( Berlin - Frankfurt - Muenster protocol ) a 70 to 75 % DFS is seen in all patients regardless of initial WBC , suggesting that effective therapy will override prognostic factors . Ultra - high - dose MTX , without cranial radiation , is also showing promise in poor prognosis patients . Other issues include the optimal duration of therapy , the role of testicular biopsies , and prophylactic testicular radiation . Recent studies suggest that prognostic factors lose their significance after 2 years of continuous complete remission and that 2 years of maintenance therapy is adequate . Bilateral open - wedge testicular biopsies have identified occult testicular disease in 8 to 10 % of males . A unified approach to children with leukemia / lymphoma , a group with a particularly poor prognosis , utilizing NHL - type therapy may be more effective than conventional ALL therapy . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS ) Glucocorticoid receptor and in vitro sensitivity to steroid hormones in human lymphoproliferative diseases and myeloid leukemia . The glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) quantitation by a whole - cell assay and / or cytosol technique and the in vitro sensitivity to steroids have been assessed in peripheral blood cells from normal donors and patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia ( CLL ) , acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) , lymphosarcoma cell leukemia ( LSCL ) , acute nonlymphatic leukemia ( ANLL ) , and chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) . Within the lymphoproliferative diseases , ALL cells exhibited the highest GR concentration ( regardless of the method used ) and the highest in vitro inhibition of spontaneous [ 3H ] thymidine ( [ 3H ] TdR ) uptake by glucocorticoids . A significant relationship between GR concentration ( whole - cell assay ) and in vitro sensitivity to dexamethasone was also found . On the contrary , CLL cells presented the highest sensitivity to glucocorticoids in PHA - stimulated cell cultures . Cells from the only two ALL patients who did not undergo a remission after glucocorticoid - inclusive chemotherapy had both the lowest in vitro sensitivity to dexamethasone and the lowest GR concentration with whole - cell assay . Concerning myeloid leukemia , ANLL patients had GR concentrations slightly higher than those found in the ALL group but exhibited the lowest degree of inhibition of spontaneous [ 3H ] TdR uptake by dexamethasone ( stimulatory effects occurred in some cases ) . CML cells exhibited an inhibition degree by in vitro glucocorticoids significantly higher than that of ANLL cells but not different from that of lymphoproliferative diseases . No clear relationship among GR pattern , in vitro cell sensitivity to glucocorticoids , and clinicohematologic parameters was observed in myeloid leukemia - bearing patients . Glucocorticoid receptors and in vitro corticosensitivity of peanut - positive and peanut - negative human thymocyte subpopulations . In 6 human thymus glands , the immature subset of thymocytes was separated from the more mature one , by differential peanut lectin agglutination . These 2 cell subpopulations were analyzed for glucocorticoid receptor content by using a whole cell assay , with ( 3H ) - triamcinolone acetonide as tracer . The unagglutinated thymocytes ( peanut negative ) contained about 2 times more receptor sites per cell than agglutinated ( peanut positive ) ones ( 7650 + / - 1550 S . D . verus 3195 + / - 896 S . D . ) . The affinity for steroid was similar in both cell subsets , as was the stereospecificity for glucocorticoids , the time - course of steroid - receptor association , and cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation . Despite the greater number of glucocorticoid receptor sites , the peanut - negative thymocyte subpopulation did not differ from the peanut - positive one in its sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of triamcinolone acetonide , as determined by measurements of the incorporation of radiolabeled precursors of protein and DNA . Moreover , the peanut - negative subset appeared more resistant in vitro to the steroid - induced cell lysis as compared to the peanut - positive one . Thus , our data suggest that glucocorticoid receptor density and corticosensitivity are not directly correlated and that the number of glucocorticoid receptor sites may be dependent on the degree of immunologic maturation Defective binding and function of 1 , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptors in peripheral mononuclear cells of patients with end - organ resistance to 1 , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D . Lectin - induced DNA synthesis by peripheral mononuclear cells from 17 normal donors was inhibited ( 40 - 60 % ) by 1 , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 , 25 [ OH ] 2D3 ) at physiological concentrations ( 10 ( - 10 ) - 10 ( - 9 ) M ) . The lymphocytes acquire specific receptors for 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 upon activation by the lectins . This process precedes the inhibitory effect of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 . We studied lymphocytes from six patients from four different kindreds with the syndrome of hereditary end - organ resistance to 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D ( the so - called vitamin D - dependent rickets type II ) . In five patients ( three kindreds ) peripheral blood mononuclear cells did not acquire receptors for 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 upon phytohemagglutinin - induced activation . Moreover , in contrast to normal lymphocytes , the mitogenic stimulation of these patients ' lymphocytes by phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A was not inhibited by 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 . Activated lymphocytes of the sixth patient from a fourth kindred exhibited normal binding of [ 3H ] 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 but the hormone failed to inhibit the mitogenic stimulation . A similar pattern of the vitamin D effector system was previously observed in fibroblasts cultured from skin biopsies of the same group of patients . The conclusions from these findings are : ( a ) the inhibition of mitogenic stimulation by 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 is mediated by specific functional receptors to the hormone ; and ( b ) the receptors for 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 in mononuclear cells are probably controlled genetically by the same mechanisms as the effector system in well - characterized target organs of the hormone , such as intestine and kidney . Glucocorticoid receptors of mononuclear leukocytes from myasthenia gravis patients . The present study was performed to analyse glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) binding in peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes ( MNL ) from 39 myasthenia gravis ( MG ) patients ( unoperated patients ( n = 13 ) , thymectomized patients ( n = 14 ) and patients receiving glucocorticoids : thymectomized ( n = 11 ) and unoperated ( n = 6 ] . A whole cell binding assay with 3 ( H ) dexamethasone was used . GR mean values were significantly higher in the MNL of MG patients ( thymectomized or not ) not receiving glucocorticoid than in the MNL of healthy donors . Affinity was within the normal range . Sex , age or clinical forms of illness did not influence the results . In patients receiving prednisone ( Pd ) the GR values were significantly lower than in MG patients without Pd therapy , independent of Pd dose or time of administration . No differences in receptor binding between normal subjects and MG patients receiving Pd have been found . Immunological interference of high dose corticosteroids . High - dose corticosteroids ( HDC ) will influence cellular as well as humoral participants of the immune response . The lymphoid tissue will decrease in size and weight after prolonged treatment with HDC . Lymphocyte functions will be impaired . Reduced synthesis of B - as well as T - lymphocytes will be seen . The inhibitory effect on B - cell function can be observed both as decreased serum levels of immunoglobulins and as impaired binding of antibodies and complement to the cellular surface . Reduced T - cell function indicated by impaired stimulation by PHA and porkweed as well as by impaired lymphokinin effects on leukocyte migration inhibition has been reported . Reduced lymphocyte adherence to antigen and suppressed lymphocyte reaction have also been observed . Humoral factors involved in chemotaxis , opsonisation , phagocytosis , vascular permeability leading to leakage of fluid and cells and factors involved in lysis of antigens are impaired . This can be explained partly by the observed reduced complement activation via the alternative as well as the classical pathway in association with HDC therapy . Acute processes with increased vascular permeability and accumulation of leukocytes as impairing factors could be influenced beneficially by HDC therapy . This positive effect can be seen in treatment of septic shock or rejection of a transplant . However , if sepsis or rejection is not rapidly reversed , complications such as multisystem organ failure and bacteremia are prone to appear . Identification of human leukemic glucocorticoid receptors using affinity labeling and anti - human glucocorticoid receptor antibodies . Antisera raised against human lymphoid glucocorticoid receptors were used in combination with the glucocorticoid receptor affinity label [ 3H ] dexamethasone 21 - mesylate [ ( 3H ] DM ) to identify the glucocorticoid receptors of the human B - lymphoblastoid cell line IM - 9 and the human T - cell leukemic cell line CEM - C7 . Antisera were obtained following immunization of New Zealand White rabbits with [ 3H ] triamcinolone acetonide [ ( 3H ] TA ) - glucocorticoid receptor complexes partially purified by two - stage DNA - cellulose chromatography . The presence of anti - human glucocorticoid receptor antibodies was verified by : ( a ) adsorption of [ 3H ] TA - receptor - antibody complexes to Protein A ; ( b ) a shift to higher apparent molecular weight in the elution position from Sephacryl S300 of [ 3H ] TA - receptor complexes incubated with immune serum ; and ( c ) the ability of immune serum to displace [ 3H ] TA - receptor complexes on sucrose gradients . These antibodies also recognized rat liver and murine S49 cell glucocorticoid receptors . Sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of [ 3H ] DM - labeled IM - 9 cytosol identified a major competable band with a molecular weight of approximately 90 , 000 , three minor competable components with molecular weights of approximately 78 , 000 , approximately 51 , 000 , and approximately 38 , 500 , and at least 21 other noncompetable components . Following immunoprecipitation of [ 3H ] DM - labeled cytosol with immune serum , only the Mr 90 , 000 and 78 , 000 components were seen . Sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of [ 3H ] DM - labeled CEM - C7 cytosol revealed a larger number of [ 3H ] DM - labeled components . However , after immunoprecipitation of [ 3H ] DM - labeled CEM - C7 cytosol , a predominant competable component with a molecular weight of 90 , 000 was easily identified . This component was markedly diminished when cytosols from the glucocorticoid receptor - deficient cell line ICR - 27 were used . Thus , the combination of affinity labeling and anti - human glucocorticoid receptor antibodies is capable of providing direct physical identification of human lymphoid glucocorticoid receptors . Effect of thymosin on glucocorticoid receptor activity and glucocorticoid sensitivity of human thymocytes . Incubation with thymosin fraction 5 , ( TMS F5 at 300 micrograms / ml ) a partially purified thymic factor , reduced the steroid binding activity of human infant thymocytes from 9 . 6 + / - 2 . 1 fmole / ml to 5 . 0 + / - 2 . 0 fmole / ml . The glucocorticoid receptor activity in normal infant thymocytes was found to be 2 , 146 + / - 726 ( s . d . ) sites per cell with dissociation constant of 1 . 4 + / - 0 . 6 X 10 ( - 8 ) M . TMS F5 also increased the resistance of human thymocytes to the cytolytic effect of dexamethasone ( 2 . 5 X 10 ( - 8 ) M ) to 168 . 6 + / - 30 . 2 % of control ( P less than 0 . 01 ) . In animals , medullary and peripheral blood T cells are more resistant to glucocorticoids than immature thymic T cells . The results show that thymosin can induce changes consistent with differentiation in human thymocytes . These in vitro results are consistent with a physiological role of thymosin in intrathymic T cell maturation in man . Incubation of a human malignant thymus derived T cell line ( MOLT 3 ) with TMS F5 also resulted in a significant reduction of the number of steroid binding sites to 44 . 2 + / - 15 . 3 % of control ( P less than 0 . 05 ) , but TMS F5 did not significantly reduce the glucocorticoid sensitivity of MOLT 3 cells . Specific high - affinity receptors for 1 , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells : presence in monocytes and induction in T lymphocytes following activation . Human peripheral blood monocytes have high affinity binding sites for 1 , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 ( Kd 0 . 14 nM , sedimentation coefficient 3 . 7S ) . Resting human peripheral blood T lymphocytes , however , do not have a demonstrable 1 , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 receptor . After activation with phytohemagglutinin the T cells exhibit the receptor within 24 h , and this expression is blocked by cycloheximide . The receptor in activated T lymphocytes has a sedimentation coefficient of 3 . 7S and a high affinity ( Kd 0 . 10 nM ) for the ligand . Effects of chronic glucocorticoid excess in man on insulin binding to circulating cells : differences between endogenous and exogenous hypercorticism . We measured [ 125I ] insulin binding to circulating monocytes or erythrocytes from 16 patients with chronic glucocorticoid excess , 9 chronically treated with prednisone and 7 with adrenocortical hyperfunction . With monocytes , [ 125I ] insulin binding was iincreased in all patients . Analysis of binding data indicated that increased binding in patients treated with prednisone was due to an ncrease in receptor concentration , whereas in patients with adrenocortical hyperfunction , it was due to an increase in receptor affinity . With erythrocytes from patients with adrenocortical hyperfunction there was an increase in receptor affinity and a decrease in receptor concentration , so that the binding of [ 125I ] insulin was normal . The disparity of results between endogenous and exogenous hypercorticism , between the two cell types , and between the present studies and previous studies suggest that the effects of glucocorticoid excess on the insulin receptor are extremely complex and wide - ranging and that in this condition , extrapolations in humans from data with circulating cells to liver and muscle may not be appropriate . Reduced level of cellular glucocorticoid receptors in patients with anorexia nervosa . Specific glucocorticoid receptors were measured in circulating mononuclear leukocytes from 12 patients with anorexia nervosa and 21 healthy control subjects . Cells from patients were found to contain a significantly ( p less than 0 . 01 ) lower level of glucocorticoid receptor ( 3830 + / - 210 sites / cell , mean + / - SE ) than those from controls ( 4930 + / - 250 sites / cell ) . A partial glucocorticoid receptor defect may well explain the abnormal cortisol metabolism and glucocorticoid resistance commonly found in patients with anorexia nervosa . Regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor in human lymphocytes . The presence of a glucocorticoid receptor in human lymphocytes is well established , but factors affecting its regulation have not been described . Using a competitive binding whole cell assay , we have examined the binding of [ 3H ] - dexamethasone at 24 and 37 degrees C in untreated normal subjects and in healthy subjects taking various glucocorticoid preparations . At 24 degrees C normal human lymphocytes had 6000 binding sites / cell and a dissociation constant of 4 x 10 ( - 9 ) M . The administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone , 5 mg of prednisone , and 37 . 5 mg of cortisone acetate resulted in a 30 % decrease in binding sites after 1 week with no change in binding affinity . No changes in the number of binding sites was noted before 1 week and the diminished number persisted for 1 week after discontinuation of glucocorticoid treatment . Lymphocytes from hospitalized patients taking 40 - 60 mg of dexamethasone daily demonstrated the same change in number of binding sites that was seen in normal subjects taking 1 mg of dexamethasone . When binding assays were carried out at physiologic temperature there was the same decrease in number of binding sites after dexamethasone administration , and in addition , there was a two - fold increase in binding affinity . Glucocorticoid administration results in a time - dependent decrease in the number of lymphocyte glucocorticoid binding sites that is independent of the type of glucocorticoid administered . This is the first in vivo demonstration that glucocorticoids modulate their own receptors in man . Immunoglobulin localization in benign and malignant lesions of the human mammary gland . Using direct imunofluorescence , lesions from 266 human breast specimens were studied for the presence of IgA , IgM , or IgG localization . The lesions included benign elements from 66 subcutaneous mastectomy specimens in which the absence of simultaneous breast malignancy was documented , primary breast carcinomas from 153 mastectomy specimens , and 47 biopsies containing metastatic breast cancer . A statistically significant association of IgA and IgM with benign lesions was contrasted to the association of IgG with malignant lesions . In both primary and metastatic lesions , IgG localization was associated with estrogen - receptor - poor primary cancers as compared with estrogen - receptor - rich primary cancers . Among primary breast cancer patients , IgG localization in the tumor correlated with relative lymphopenia . A shorter disease - free interval was noted in association with IgG localization among the metastatic breast lesions . No statistically significant association between stage of disease and immunoglobulin presence was demonstrable . Moderate - to - severe intraductal epithelial hyperplasias were more often associated with immunoglobulin G localization that were other benign lesions Correlation of steroid receptors with histologic differentiation in mammary carcinoma . A Singapore experience . Cancer of the breast is the most common tumor in females in Singapore , with the rate of 20 . 7 per 100 , 000 per year ( 1977 estimate ) , which is predicted to increase to 29 . 8 per 100 , 000 women per year by 1995 . A detailed histopathologic review of 50 primary breast cancer tumors analyzed for estrogen receptor ( ER ) level was carried out and a variety of morphologic features correlated with ER results to identify any factors that will improve the management and prognosis for breast cancer . Cytosol was incubated with 3H - estradiol in the presence and absence of cold diethylstilbestrol , and bound and free hormone were separated by Dextran - coated charcoal method . Tumors binding more than 5 fmol / mg cytosol protein were classified as ER - positive . Progesterone receptor ( PR ) level was analyzed in some specimens with the use of a similar method . Most of the patients were Chinese ( 90 % ) . Three patients were Malays , one was Indian , and one was European in this series . Results indicated that there was strong correlation between ER level , age , and histologic grade of the tumors . No correlation existed between absence or presence of lymph node metastases and ER . Although there was a trend for ER - positive tumors to have a low - grade lymphocytic infiltration , the difference was not statistically significant . Mononuclear cells infiltrating human mammary carcinomas : immunohistochemical analysis with monoclonal antibodies . Breast carcinomas were examined by the immunoperoxidase technique using antisera specific for lymphocyte subsets , monocytes , NK cells and major histocompatibility antigens ( HLA - A , - B , - C ; Ia - like ) . Sixty - four per cent of the patients had a moderate or strong mononuclear cell infiltration , 77 % of the patients without mononuclear cell infiltration had receptors for estrogens as compared to 51 % of the patients with infiltration . The majority of the infiltrating mononuclear cells were T cells ; generally the OKT8 cells were predominant . The Leu 3A / OKT8 cell ratio was not related to histological type , tumor size , age of the patient or presence of metastases . Some of the T cells had the Ia antigen and were thus probably activated . The B cells were either absent or less numerous than the T cells . There was no relation between their distribution and the various parameters studied . A few monocytes were heterogeneous according to their markers ( OKM I and acid phosphatase ) . In 6 cases only there was a strong infiltration of mononuclear cells positive for acid phosphatase . The number of the natural killer cells was also low . Only a few mononuclear infiltrating cells had receptors for transferrin . There was a positive correlation between the inflammatory infiltration and the presence of HLA class - I antigens on tumor cell s . Some of the antisera specific for lymphocyte subsets also stained the breast carcinoma cells . The great variations in the subsets of mononuclear cells in breast carcinomas may correspond to various systems of defense against neoplasm . A case of male pseudohermaphroditis with normal androgen receptor binding and 47 , XYY karyotype . A case of male pseudohermaphroditis with 47 , XYY karyotype in blood and cutaneous fibroblasts is described . The plasma testosterone response to HCG stimulation was slightly below the normal range on two occasions suggesting a deficit of gonadal function . A study of the receptors for dihydrotestosterone in fibroblasts of genital and nongenital skin showed a normal concentration of receptors in genital skin ; 5 - alpha - reductase activity in fibroblasts of the genital skin was low , but the plasma relationship testosterone / dihydrotestosterone under HCG stimulation was normal . The diagnostic possibility of a complete testicular feminization syndrome with normal receptors for dihydrotestosterone is commented on . 1 , 25 - Dihydroxyvitamin D3 inhibits antigen - induced T cell activation . The proliferative response of murine spleen and thymus cells to antigen but not to lectin was inhibited by the active metabolite of vitamin D3 , 1 , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 . To directly examine the effect of 1 , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 on T cell activation in the absence of other complicating interactions , we utilized a panel of cloned Ia - restricted T cell hybridomas that secrete IL 2 on activation by cloned Ia - bearing stimulator cells ( TA3 ) or when stimulated by mitogen . Physiologic concentrations of 1 , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 ( 0 . 01 to 0 . 1 nm ) inhibited the antigen - induced secretion of IL 2 by several of these T cell hybridomas . This inhibition was dependent on the concentration of the free hormone and could be overcome by increasing the number of Ia - bearing stimulator cells used . Pretreatment of the T hybridoma but not the TA3 stimulator cell with 1 , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 resulted in inhibition of activation . These results are consistent with the finding that specific 1 , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 receptors are present on the T cell hybridomas but are lacking in TA3 cells . 1 , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 failed , however , to inhibit the activation of the T cell hybridomas by lectin or by an anti - Thy - 1 antibody . These findings suggest that 1 , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 may be interfering with early events of antigen - induced T cell activation , perhaps by hindering T cell recognition of the relevant antigen on stimulator cell surfaces . This system should prove useful in studying the molecular mechanisms by which 1 , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 acts to inhibit T cell activation and subsequent IL 2 production . Glucocorticoid receptors and steroid sensitivity in normal and neoplastic human lymphoid tissues : a review . The determination of estrogen and progesterone receptors in breast cancer has been shown to be useful in predicting the response to endocrine therapy . Given their well - known inhibitory effects on lymphoid tissue , glucocorticoids have been used widely in the treatment of leukemia . Given these facts , over the last 10 years , several investigators have measured the number of glucocorticoid receptors in normal and neoplastic lymphoid tissue to see whether their number correlated with glucocorticoid responsiveness in vitro or in vivo . No clear correlation could be established between the level of glucocorticoid receptor and the in vitro action of steroids in normal and neoplastic lymphoid tissue . In contrast , attempts to correlate glucocorticoid receptor levels in acute lymphocytic leukemia to in vivo steroid responsiveness and immunological type using the whole - cell - binding assay for receptor determination and selecting the patients according to age and immunological criteria have been more successful . [ Glucocorticoid receptors in normal human lymphocytes ] Glucocorticoid ( GC ) receptors were studied in intact lymphocytes from 11 donors . GC binding parameters were found to be highly reproducible in repeated experiments with lymphocytes . It was shown that GC receptors in donors ' lymphocytes could be distributed into two different classes similarly to the pattern seen in skin fibroblasts . Human lymphocytes are an adequate object for studying genetically determined variability of GC receptors and its clinical importance . Specific estrogen binding sites in human lymphoid cells and thymic cells . The binding of estrogen in preparations of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells , as well as by splenic and thymic cells is demonstrated by three different approaches ( Dextran - coated charcoal method , whole cell assay , and gel filtration on a sepharose 4B column ) . Scatchard ' s analysis of [ 3H ] - moxestrol ( R2858 ) and [ 3H ] - estradiol binding proves the existence of a single class of receptor sites having a dissociation constant of 0 . 18 - 2 . 4 X 10 ( - 9 ) M . Physicochemical properties of the binder , including binding capacity and steroid specificity , are quite similar to those reported for the thymus of small mammalian species or human thymoma . Administration of fibroblast interferon to patients with advanced breast cancer : possible effects on skin metastasis and on hormone receptors . Eleven patients with metastasized breast cancer received 8 intramuscular injections of 6 x 10 ( 6 ) units of human fibroblast interferon over a period of 40 days . The injections did not cause local irritation or inflammation . Fever occurred in only 1 of the 11 patients . Although several types of metastases were monitored , only skin nodules consistently ( 10 out of 11 patients ) exhibited changes that were suggestive of a therapeutic effect of the treatment regimen : either a simple decrease in size of some nodules or central necrosis accompanied by an inflammatory reaction . NK - activity of peripheral blood leukocytes was significantly increased after administration of the first dose ; the effect of subsequent injections was less clear . Receptors for estrogens and progestogens were increased in the tumor biopsies of 2 out of 2 and 5 out of 6 patients tested respectively . Decreased glucocorticoid receptor binding in adrenal insufficiency . To examine the effect of glucocorticoid deficiency on the glucocorticoid receptor , we examine the binding of [ 3H ] dexamethasone to lymphocytes in normal subjects and patients with adrenal insufficiency before and after glucocorticoid replacement therapy . Using a whole cell competitive binding assay , normal human lymphocytes had 5977 + / - 1487 ( mean + / - SD ) binding sites / cell and a dissociation constant of 10 + / - 2 nM . Lymphocytes from patients with untreated adrenal insufficiency had fewer binding sites ( 3364 + / - 322 ) and a 2 - fold increase in binding affinity ( 5 . 4 + / - 0 . 9 mM ) . The administration of conventional replacement doses of cortisone acetate for 6 months caused no change in receptor number , but was associated with a decrease in binding affinity toward normal . After long term glucocorticoid replacement therapy , binding parameters were similar to those in patients before treatment . The physiological implications of the decreased receptor number and increased binding affinity in adrenal insufficiency remain to be elucidated . Glucocorticoid receptor concentrations and terminal transferase activity as indicators of prognosis in acute non - lymphocytic leukaemia . Activity of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase ( TdT ) , adenosine deaminase , and 5 ' nucleotidase and the cellular concentration of glucocorticoid ( dexamethasone ) receptor were determined in 25 patients with acute non - lymphocytic leukaemia . All patients were treated according to a common protocol . Increased activity of TdT ( greater than 0 . 1 unit / microgram DNA ) was found in 11 patients . This group of patients was shown to have higher remission and survival rates ( p = 0 . 06 ) compared with patients with low activity of TdT . The glucocorticoid receptor concentration of the leukaemic blast cells ranged from 0 to 0 . 94 fmol / microgram DNA . Thirteen patients had blast cells with a glucocorticoid receptor concentration over 0 . 22 fmol / microgram DNA . These patients had significantly increased remission and survival rates ( p = 0 . 006 ) compared with those with a low receptor concentration . This finding can not be explained by a difference in sensitivity to glucocorticoids since these were not used as therapeutic agents . Adenosine deaminase and 5 ' nucleotidase activities both varied within two orders of magnitude . No correlation could be found between activities of these enzymes and remission or survival rate . These results show that measurements of TdT activity and the glucocorticoid receptor concentration yield valuable prognostic information in acute non - lymphocytic leukaemia [ 3H ] cortivazol : a unique high affinity ligand for the glucocorticoid receptor . Cortivazol ( CVZ ) and deacylcortivazol ( DAC ) are pyrazolosteroids with potent glucocorticoid activity . In previous work we showed that DAC is 40 - fold more potent than dexamethasone ( DEX ) in lysing leukemic lymphoblasts . To assess the interaction between these atypical steroids and the glucocorticoid receptor , we examined the binding of [ 3H ] CVZ to cytosol from glucocorticoid - sensitive and - resistant variants of the human leukemic cell line CEM C7 . In glucocorticoid - sensitive cells [ 3H ] CVZ causes a 2 - fold induction of glutamine synthetase and binds to a protein in the 4 . 6 S region of high salt sucrose gradients . On DEAE - cellulose chromatography , [ 3H ] CVZ - receptor complexes show a shift from high ( 0 . 25 M KP ) to low salt ( 0 . 09 M KP ) eluting forms upon activation . CVZ competes for a 97 , 000 - dalton protein labeled by [ 3H ] dexamethasone mesylate . Scatchard analysis of the binding of [ 3H ] CVZ in glucocorticoid - sensitive cells revealed a curvilinear plot which resolved into high ( 0 . 4 nM ) and low ( 11 nM ) affinity components . The receptor concentration of the low affinity site ( 0 . 30 pmol / mg protein ) was approximately twice that of the high affinity site ( 0 . 14 pmol / mg protein ) . Dissociation experiments with dilution and / or excess unlabeled CVZ supported the presence of independent sites . In contrast , the binding of [ 3H ] DEX to C7 cytosol revealed a single class of binding sites ( Kd = 1 . 9 nM ; receptor concentration , 0 . 46 pmol / mg protein ) . Examination of the binding of [ 3H ] CVZ using 10 ( - 5 ) M DEX as the competing ligand showed that DEX binds only to the low affinity site detected by [ 3H ] CVZ . In cytosol from a glucocorticoid - resistant cell line with virtually no [ 3H ] DEX binding , [ 3H ] CVZ detected a single high affinity binding site that was similar in dissociation constant ( 0 . 8 nM ) and receptor concentration ( 0 . 13 pmol / mg protein ) to the high affinity site detected in the glucocorticoid - sensitive cell line C7 . A controlled pore glass bead assay for the measurement of cytoplasmic and nuclear glucocorticoid receptors . An assay for the quantitation of cytoplasmic and nuclear glucocorticoid receptors in lymphoid tissue has been developed using controlled pore glass ( CPG ) beads . Soluble receptor - - 3H - steroid complex ( cytosol or nuclear extract ) is adsorbed quantitatively within the crevasses of porous glass beads . Excess labeled steroid as well as most non - specifically bound steroid is easily washed away , leaving the hormone - receptor complex retained by the beads . Bound 3H - steroid is eluted with ethanol and measured for radioactivity . This procedure which is simple , rapid , and highly reproducible is carried out using frozen samples ( stable for many months ) containing as few as 1 X 10 ( 7 ) cells . A comparison of the CPG assay to dextran coated charcoal and a whole cell assay demonstrates that CPG and dextran coated charcoal give equivalent measurements of cytosolic receptor concentration , while the CPG and whole cell assays provide equivalent values for total receptor content . Plasmacytoid blast crisis in B - cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia : effect of estradiol on growth and differentiation in vitro . Evolution of a case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) into blast crisis was found to be characterized by three unusual features ( 1 ) the phenotype of the emerging blast cells was that of pre - plasmacytoid cells as shown by plasma cell morphology and an immunological phenotype corresponding partially with CLL - or intermediate B - cells , partially with plasma cells ( terminal transferase - , common acute lymphocytic leukemia antigen - , Ia + , surface immunoglobulin heavy chains - , surface kappa light chains + , intracytoplasmic immunoglobulin A + and G + , BA - 1 + , polyclonal gammaglobulin production ) ; ( 2 ) cytogenetic analysis of spontaneous metaphases revealed that in addition to the typical CLL abnormality , trisomy 12 , in all of the cells , an additional translocation between chromosomes 14 and 17 was present in 40 % with a presumptive breakpoint on chromosome 14 ( q12 - 3 ) never described before ( commonly q32 ) and ( 3 ) the progression of the disease was associated with a striking increase in the expression by the transformed cells of specific binding sites for estradiol ( E2 ) due to an actual increase in total cellular receptor proteins and not to a change in receptor affinity for E2 . The functional status of the steroid receptors was confirmed by nuclear transfer of the cytoplasmic hormone - receptor complex upon temperature activation . Since the rise in E2 - receptor display paralleled a large increase in the proliferative activity of the cells as well as a change in their maturation status the question was raised as to whether the E2 - receptor should be considered as a physiological marker of growth rate or of cellular differentiation . Exposure of the patient ' s blast cells to E2 in vitro resulted in cessation of cell growth following at least one mitosis after addition of the inducer as seen from the replacement of the large blasts by small CLL - like cells without definite signs of alteration of the differentiation status . This suggests the association of E2 - receptor expression with control of growth rather than cell maturation . Multiple forms and fragments of cytosolic glucocorticoid receptors from human leukemic cells and normal lymphocytes . Therapy with glucocorticoids is generally more effective in acute lymphoblastic leukemia than in other types of human leukemia . Previous studies , however , have not revealed any consistent relationship between clinical responsiveness and the cellular or cytosolic concentration of glucocorticoid - binding sites . The objectives of this study were to determine whether there are intrinsic structural differences among the glucocorticoid receptors in various types of leukemic cells and normal lymphocytes and to investigate the role of endogenous peptidases in receptor degradation . Cytosols were prepared from fresh or rapidly frozen leukocytes from 6 healthy adults and 35 high - risk leukemia patients ( median white blood cell count , 150 , 000 cells / microliter ; median age , 13 years ) . Receptors were labeled with [ 3H ] triamcinolone acetonide and quantitated by charcoal - dextran treatment or Sephadex LH - 20 chromatography . Mean and median cytosolic receptor concentrations in 12 acute lymphoblastic leukemia specimens lacking the standard B - cell or T - cell markers ( ` ` null cells ' ' ) were approximately 4 - fold higher than in 23 other leukemic cell specimens . No other consistent differences in receptor content were observed . Agarose filtration and ultracentrifugation in hypotonic buffers containing 20 mM Na2MoO4 revealed complexes of similar size and shape in all clinical specimens tested and two established leukemic cell lines . They had Stokes radii ( Rs ) of 8 . 1 + / - 0 . 5 ( S . D . ) nm ( n = 50 ) , sedimentation coefficients of 9 . 5 + / - 0 . 3S ( n = 40 ) , molecular weights of approximately 330 , 000 , and axial ratios ( a / b ) of approximately 12 . In hypertonic , molybdate - free buffer , these oligomeric complexes were dissociated into subunits with Rs of 5 . 9 + / - 0 . 3 nm ( n = 12 ) and a / b of 11 to 12 , as observed previously for other receptors . Fragmentation of the oligomer and the subunit was evident in some cytosols . High activities of peptidases of various specificities were detected in leukemic cell cytosols , as in other cytosols , by fluorometric assays with derivatives of 7 - amino - 4 - methylcoumarin . Receptor cleavage by these and other endogenous enzymes may account for previous observations of ` ` abnormal ' ' receptors in cytosols from some leukemic specimens . We conclude that intrinsic structural defects in the receptors are unlikely explanations for the unresponsiveness of some types of leukemia to steroid therapy . Glucocorticoid receptor number and intracellular water space . In order to elucidate the relationship between cell water content and number of glucocorticoid receptors , eleven normal and malignant lymphoid or myelomonocytic cell types originating from mouse , rat and man were investigated . The cellular water space was measured with 3H2O , and glucocorticoid receptor number was measured in a whole - cell binding assay with [ 3H ] dexamethasone at 30 and 37 degrees C . The intracellular water phase concentration of glucocorticoid receptors ( around 40 nmol / l cell water ) , and the dependence of receptor affinity on temperature were similar in normal and malignant rodent and human cells . It is concluded that comparisons of glucocorticoid receptor levels are best made on the basis of intracellular receptor concentrations . Covalent labeling of rat thymocyte and human lymphoid glucocorticoid receptor . Lymphoid cells contain specific receptors for glucocorticoids . We have used [ 3H ] dexamethasone - 21 - mesylate to label covalently glucocorticoid receptors in rat thymic lymphocytes and in neoplastic cells obtained from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and malignant lymphoma . The covalently labeled glucocorticoid receptors were identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( in the presence of 0 . 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ) . In cytosolic fractions prepared from rat thymic lymphocytes , [ 3H ] - dexamethasone - 21 - mesylate labels a protein ( Mr approximately equal to 95 , 000 ) which was identified as the glucocorticoid receptor by the following criteria : ( a ) labeling of this moiety is inhibited by treatment with a 100 - fold molar excess of glucocorticoids , such as dexamethasone and triamcinolone acetonide ; and ( b ) the covalently labeled Mr approximately equal to 95 , 000 protein is activated ( by heating at 20 degrees for 30 min ) to a form that binds to DNA - cellulose . When intact thymocytes are treated with [ 3H ] dexamethasone - 21 - mesylate , an Mr approximately equal to 95 , 000 moiety is also labeled covalently . Approximately 35 % of the glucocorticoid receptors can be labeled covalently when intact thymocytes are treated with 100 nM [ 3H ] dexamethasone - 21 - mesylate for 30 min at 4 degrees . Neoplastic cells from acute lymphoblastic leukemia and malignant lymphoma were treated with [ 3H ] dexamethasone - 21 - mesylate . In all samples , an Mr approximately equal to 95 , 000 moiety was labeled covalently ; labeling was inhibited by excess glucocorticoid . Smaller moieties were also identified by competition experiments ; these may represent proteolytic fragments of the Mr approximately equal to 95 , 000 receptor . Thus , in rat and human lymphoid cells , [ 3H ] dexamethasone - 21 - mesylate can be used to label covalently the glucocorticoid receptor . The association of cytosol oestrogen and progesterone receptors with histological features of breast cancer and early recurrence of disease . Two hundred and eighty - eight primary breast tumours were examined for the presence or absence of oestrogen ( REc ) and progesterone ( RPc ) receptors . Analysis has shown a relative interdependence between the steroid receptor status of primary breast cancer and other prognostic variables such as histological grade , lymphocytic infiltration and tumour elastosis . There were significant associations between epithelial cellularity , stromal fibrosis and the value of REc in those tumours in which the receptor was present . Cellularity and fibrosis were unrelated to the presence or absence of oestrogen receptor . By contrast , neither the presence or absence nor the value of RPc could be related to cellularity or fibrosis . The value of REc and RPc analysis as an indicator of prognosis was examined in a sub - group of 175 patients receiving no additional treatment following mastectomy . Overall relapse - free survival ( RFS ) was no different for those patients with receptors compared to those without them ( REc P = 0 . 11 , RPc P = 0 . 7 ) . There was no difference in RFS of receptor positive and negative tumours when the axillary node status was taken into account . Clinical implications of glucocorticoid receptors in human leukemia . Normal lymphoid cells contain glucocorticoid receptor . A variety of stimuli that activate these cells also induce increases in receptor concentration . Similar glucocorticoid receptors can be detected in lymphoid cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) . Absence of the glucocorticoid receptor ( usually found in treated patients ) predicts lack of glucocorticoid responsiveness . Furthermore , in our hands , glucocorticoid receptor levels correlate with the duration of complete remission in ALL ( though not in other forms of leukemia ) . This association is independent of cell type , age , sex , or initial leukocyte count . The level of receptor shows a negative correlation with increasing aggressiveness of the tumor ( null - cell leukemia greater than T - cell leukemia greater than Burkitt ' s lymphoma ) . Corticosteroid - mediated immunoregulation in man . Glucocorticoids have profound and complex effects on the human immune response . However , the precise mechanisms of the corticosteroid - induced immunoregulation in man have not been precisely defined . Intracytoplasmic corticosteroid - specific receptors appear to be an important common pathway for steroid - induced changes , but variations of receptor parameters do not account for the multifaceted effects on the immune system . Human circulating mononuclear cells redistribute out of the intravascular compartment following treatment with corticosteroids . Although certain components at this redistribution phenomenon have been well - characterized , the importance of this compartmental cellular shift with respect to the mechanisms of corticosteroid - induced immunoregulation are less well - defined . Recent observations that activated lymphocytes may be sensitive to the lytic effects of glucocorticoids suggest that under certain situations the elimination of selected subsets of cells may be a relevant mechanism of corticosteroid - mediated immunoregulation in man . Corticosteroid - mediated effects on monocyte function may be an important mechanism of drug - induced immunoregulation in monocyte - dependent responses . In some experimental conditions , corticosteroids inhibit Interleukin 1 production by monocytes . The immunoregulatory effects of corticosteroids on lymphocyte immune responses are complex . In vitro corticosteroids appear to selectively affect early immunoregulatory events as opposed to altering an established response . Multiple sites of steroid - induced modulations of human B cell responses have been defined . Human lymphoid cell lines and glucocorticoids : II . Whole cell and cytoplasmic binding properties of lymphoblastoid , leukaemia and lymphoma lines . The glucocorticoid binding properties of 18 human lymphoid cell lines ( HLCL ) have been investigated . The specificity of steroid binding was confirmed with various glucocorticoid agonists and antagonists . A gradation in whole cell and cytoplasmic glucocorticoid binding capacity was observed in the different cell line types : lymphoblastoid greater than lymphoma greater than leukaemia . The cytoplasmic receptors of leukaemia and lymphoblastoid lines appeared to contain both proteinaceous and phospholipid components . Cytoplasmic steroid - receptor complexes exhibited a wide range of sedimentation coefficients ( 8 . 5 - 11 . 3S ) in low ionic strength buffer but there was no correlation with cell line type or glucocorticoid sensitivity . Activation of these complexes by heat ( 37 degrees C ) or exposure to high ionic strength buffer ( 0 . 3 M NaCl ) induced nuclear binding of steroid but only complexes in high ionic strength buffer manifested changes in sedimentation coefficient . No correlation was observed between the level or nature of glucocorticoid binding and the cytolethal or cytostatic responsiveness of HLCL to glucocorticoid treatment in vitro . The resistance to cytolethal effects can not be ascribed to a failure of cells to take up and bind steroid or to significant differences in the molecular species of cytoplasmic receptors present . The molecular mechanisms by which glucocorticoids achieve cytolethal responses in human lymphoid cells CD28 - mediated activation in CD45RA + and CD45RO + T cells : enhanced levels of reactive oxygen intermediates and c - Rel nuclear translocation in CD45RA + cells . We have analyzed the effect of complete T cell activation ( anti - CD3 plus anti - CD28 ) on the activation of NF - kappaB in CD45RA + ( naive ) and CD45RO + ( memory / effector ) T cells . Long exposure ( 24 h ) induced stronger NF - kappaB DNA binding in CD45RA + cells than in CD45RO + cells . Analysis of the nuclear c - Rel protein indicated that after anti - CD3 + anti - CD28 stimulation the level of c - Rel was higher in CD45RA + cells . Analysis of the cytoplasmic inhibitor IkappaBalpha indicated that anti - CD3 + anti - CD28 stimulation induced a long - lasting degradation in CD45RA + cells but in CD45RO + cells the degradation process was more rapid . Because the CD28 costimulus is known to induce the production of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROIs ) , the intracellular ROI levels in CD45RA + and CD45RO + cells were compared by flow cytometry . ROIs were produced in both cell types , but more strongly in CD45RA + cells . The data presented in this study further emphasize the differences between CD45RA + and CD45RO + T lymphocytes in ROI - dependent signaling pathways . Ikaros in hemopoietic lineage determination and homeostasis . Studies on the molecular mechanisms that control hemopoietic differentiation have focused on signaling cascades and nuclear effectors that drive this complex developmental system in a regulated fashion . Here we review the role of Ikaros , the founding member of a unique family of zinc finger transcription factors in this developmental process . Studies on an Ikaros null mutation have revealed an essential role for this factor in lymphoid cell fate determination and at subsequent branch points of the T cell differentiation pathway . Differences in the phenotypes of a null and a dominant negative ( DN ) Ikaros mutation provide insight into a regulatory network through which Ikaros proteins exert their effects in development . In addition a comparative analysis of the hemopoietic stem cell and precursor compartment resulting from the two Ikaros mutations reveals a profound yet not absolute requirement for Ikaros in the production and differentiation of these populations . Overexpression of p65 and c - Jun substitutes for B7 - 1 costimulation by targeting the CD28RE within the IL - 2 promoter . The role of Rel and activation protein - 1 ( AP - 1 ) in IL - 2 promoter activity in B7 - 1 - and leukocyte function - associated Ag - 3 ( LFA . 3 ) - costimulated T cells has been evaluated . We demonstrate that overexpression of c - Jun but not c - Fos increases IL - 2 promoter activity in both B7 - 1 - and LFA - 3 - costimulated Jurkat T cells . Cotransfection of both c - Jun and c - Fos substitutes for B7 - 1 costimulation in driving an activation protein - 1 response element but not for the IL - 2 promoter . Overexpression of Rel proteins demonstrated that p65 - expressing Jurkat cells transcribed equally well a nuclear factor kappabeta reporter construct when costimulated with B7 - 1 or LFA - 3 , but transcription of IL - 2 promoter or CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) - driven reporters was superior in B7 - 1 - costimulated cells . Combined expression of c - Jun and p65 induced vigorous transcription of IL - 2 promoter - and CD28RE - driven reporter constructs in both LFA - 3 - and B7 - 1 - costimulated Jurkat cells . Mutating the CD28RE but not the upstream nuclear factor kappabeta - binding site in the IL - 2 promoter reduced B7 - 1 - driven transcription > 90 % . The results implicates a major role of the CD28RE in the integration of p65 / c - Jun - mediated transcription within the IL - 2 promoter . We suggest that the transition from an autocrine LFA - 3 - driven immune response to a B7 - - induced paracrine immune response involves the activation of c - Jun and p65 , which target the CD28RE region of the IL - 2 promoter . Defects in actin - cap formation in Vav - deficient mice implicate an actin requirement for lymphocyte signal transduction . BACKGROUND : Antigen - receptor interactions on lymphocytes result in local clustering of actin , receptors and signaling molecules into an asymmetric membrane structure termed a cap . Although actin polymerization is known to be required , the mechanisms underlying cap formation are unclear . We have studied the events underlying cap formation using mice bearing a null mutation in vav ( vav - / - ) , a gene that encodes a guanine - nucleotide exchange factor for the GTPase Rac . RESULTS : Lymphocytes from vav - / - mice failed to form T - cell receptor caps following activation and had a defective actin cytoskeleton . The vav - / - T cells were deficient in interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) production and proliferation , and the peak of Ca2 + mobilization was reduced although of normal duration . Activation of Jun N - terminal kinase or stress - activated kinase ( JNK or SAPK ) and mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) and the induction of the transcription factor NF - ATc1 and egr - 1 genes was normal . Despite the reduced Ca2 + mobilization , translocation of cytoplasmic NF - ATc to the nucleus was normal , reflecting that the lower levels of Ca2 + in vav - / - cells were still sufficient to activate calcineurin . Treatment of lymphocytes with cytochalasin D , which blocks actin polymerization , inhibited cap formation and produced defects in signaling and IL - 2 transcriptional induction in response to antigen - receptor signaling that were nearly identical to those seen in vav - / - cells . In transfection studies , either constitutively active Vav or Rac could complement constitutively active calcineurin to activate NF - AT - dependent transcription . CONCLUSIONS : These results indicate that Vav is required for cap formation in lymphocytes . Furthermore , the correlation between cap formation , IL - 2 production and proliferation supports the hypothesis that an actin - dependent pathway is a source of specialized growth regulatory signals . CD14 - dependent activation of human endothelial cells by Bacteroides fragilis outer membrane . We studied the capacity of isolated Bacteriodes fragilis outer membrane , B . fragilis NCTC9343 lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ; endotoxin ) , and B . fragilis NCTC9343 capsular polysaccharides to activate human umbilical vein endothelial cell ( HUVEC ) monolayers . To assess HUVEC activation , E - selectin expression was measured by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , Northern blot analysis for E - selectin - specific mRNA , and electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) for NF - kappa B , a transcription factor necessary for E - selectin gene activation . Exposure of HUVECs to B . fragilis outer membrane fractions , separated from other components of the B . fragilis cell wall by isopycnic , sucrose gradient centrifugation , significantly increased surface expression of E - selectin and induced functional endothelial cell - dependent leukocyte adhesion . B . fragilis outer membranes induced translocation of NF - kappa B to HUVEC nuclei and accumulation of E - selectin mRNA in HUVEC cytoplasm . E - selectin expression induced by B . fragilis outer membranes was not blocked by polymixin B . In contrast , E - selectin expression induced by outer membrane fractions purified from E . coli was competitively inhibited by polymixin B . Neither purified B . fragilis LPS , a prominent constituent of the outer membrane , nor purified B . fragilis capsular polysaccharides induced HUVEC activation . Two different monoclonal antibodies directed against human CD14 completely inhibited B . fragilis outer membrane - induced NF - kappa B activation , E - selectin transcription , and E - selectin surface expression . We conclude that the outer membrane component of the B . fragilis cell wall contains a proinflammatory factor ( s ) , that is not LPS , which induces human endothelial cell activation by a soluble CD14 - dependent mechanism . NF - kappaB protects HIV - 1 - infected myeloid cells from apoptosis . HIV - 1 infection of primary monocytic cells and myeloid cell lines results in sustained NF - kappaB activation . Recently , NF - kappaB induction has been shown to play a role in protecting cells from programmed cell death . In the present study , we sought to investigate whether constitutive NF - kappaB activity in chronically HIV - 1 - infected promonocytic U937 ( U9 - IIIB ) and myeloblastic PLB - 985 ( PLB - IIIB ) cells affects apoptotic signaling . TNFalpha and cycloheximide caused infected cells to undergo apoptosis more rapidly than parental U937 and PLB - 985 cells . Inhibition of TNFalpha - induced NF - kappaB activation using the antioxidant N - acetylcysteine ( NAC ) resulted in increased apoptosis in both U937 and U9 - IIIB cells , while preactivation of NF - kappaB with the non - apoptotic inducer IL - 1beta caused a relative decrease in apoptosis . Inhibition of constitutive NF - kappaB activity in U9 - IIIB and PLB - IIIB cells also induced apoptosis , suggesting that NF - kappaB protects cells from a persistent apoptotic signal . TNFalpha plus NAC treatment resulted in a marked decrease in Bcl - 2 protein levels in HIV - 1 - infected cells , coupled with an increase in Bax protein compared to uninfected cells , suggesting that the difference in susceptibility to TNFalpha - induced apoptosis may relate to the differences in relative levels of Bcl - 2 and Bax . The protective role of NF - kappaB in blocking TNFalpha - and HIV - 1 - induced apoptosis was supported by studies in Jurkat T cells engineered to express IkappaB alpha repressor mutants ( TD - IkappaB ) under the control of a tetracycline - responsive promoter . Cells underwent apoptosis in response to TNFalpha only when NF - kappaB activation was inhibited by TD - IkappaB expression . As was observed for the U9 - IIIB cells , TNFalpha treatment also induced a marked decrease in Bcl - 2 protein levels in TD - IkappaB expressing cells . These experiments demonstrate that apoptotic signaling is perturbed in HIV - 1 - infected U9 - IIIB cells and indicate that NF - kappaB activation may play an additional protective role against HIV - 1 - induced apoptosis in myeloid cells . Human normal peripheral blood B - lymphocytes are deficient in DNA - dependent protein kinase activity due to the expression of a variant form of the Ku86 protein . The heterodimeric Ku protein , which comprises a 86 kDa ( Ku86 ) amd a 70 kDa ( Ku70 ) subunits , is an abundant nuclear DNA - binding protein which binds in vitro to DNA termini without sequence specificity . Ku is the DNA - targeting component of the large catalytic sub - unit of the DNA - dependent protein kinase complex ( DNA - PK [ CS ] ) , that plays a critical role in mammalian double - strand break repair and lymphoid V ( D ) J recombination . By using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , we demonstrated that in addition to the major Ku x DNA complex usually detected in cell line extracts , a second complex with faster electrophoretic mobility was observed in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) extracts . The presence of this faster migrating complex was restricted to B cells among the circulating lymphocyte population . Western blot analysis revealed that B cells express a variant form of the Ku86 protein with an apparent molecular weight of 69 kDa , and not the 86 kDa - full - length protein . Although the heterodimer Ku70 / variant - Ku86 binds to DNA - ends , this altered form of the Ku heterodimer has a decreased ability to recruit the catalytic component of the complex , DNA - PK ( CS ) , which contributes to an absence of detectable DNA - PK activity in B cells . These data provide a molecular basis for the increased sensitivity of B cells to ionizing radiation and identify a new mechanism of regulation of DNA - PK activity that operates in vivo . Co - stimulation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with IL - 2 and anti - CD3 monoclonal antibodies induces phosphorylation of CREB . Phosphorylation of the cAMP - response element binding protein CREB within 1 h of CD2 but not CD3 cross - linking of human PBMC was recently demonstrated . The absence of P - CREB following CD3 cross - linking was unexpected , as other laboratories reported increased phosphorylation of CREB following CD3 cross - linking of the Jurkat lymphocyte cell line . Due to Jurkat T - cells being IL - 2 - independent , it was postulated that IL - 2 might provide a necessary co - stimulus for phosphorylation of CREB in primary lymphocytes . Therefore , P - CREB was evaluated following co - stimulation of human PBMC through the IL - 2 and CD2 or CD3 receptors . IL - 2 did not further augment phosphorylation of CREB following CD2 cross - linking . However , while neither IL - 2 nor CD3 cross - linking alone induced P - CREB , a 4 . 5 - fold increase in phosphorylation of CREB within 1 h of IL - 2 / CD3 co - stimulation was observed . Phosphorylation was not associated with the induction of cAMP , and inhibition of PKA signaling had no effect on P - CREB . Consistent with signal transduction through p56lck or p59fyn , inhibition of PTK signaling reduced phosphorylation 50 % . Interestingly , inhibiting PKC signaling with calphostin C further increased P - CREB levels 3 - fold over that observed in IL - 2 / CD3 co - stimulated cells not pretreated with a PKC inhibitor . In contrast to previous studies performed in the absence of exogenous IL - 2 , no increase in binding of CREB to a 32P - labeled oligonucleotide probe was observed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay . These data suggest that the IL - 2 and CD3 signaling pathways provide a necessary and co - operative stimulus promoting phosphorylation of CREB following receptor cross - linking . HIV - 1 infection induces a selective reduction in STAT5 protein expression . HIV - 1 infection is accompanied by qualitative and quantitative defects in CD4 + T lymphocytes . Loss of immune function in HIV patients is usually associated with a profound dysregulation of cytokine production . To investigate whether cytokine signaling defects occur during HIV infection , PHA blasts from healthy human donors were infected with two strains of HIV - 1 and screened for the expression of STAT proteins used in cytokine signaling . A selective decrease in STAT5B was seen 8 days after infection with the BZ167 dual - tropic HIV isolate , but not with the Ba - L , M - tropic strain . Based on these findings , purified T cells from HIV - infected patients in different stages of disease were also tested for STAT expression ; decreases in STAT5A , STAT5B , and STAT1alpha were observed in all patients . The reduction in STATs seen in vivo and in vitro after HIV infection may contribute to the loss of T cell function in HIV disease . Transcription factors that regulate monocyte / macrophage differentiation . Although all the cells in an organism contain the same genetic information , differences in the cell phenotype arise from the expression of lineage - specific genes . During myelopoiesis , external differentiating signals regulate the expression of a set of transcription factors . The combined action of these transcription factors subsequently determines the expression of myeloid - specific genes and the generation of monocytes and macrophages . In particular , the transcription factor PU . 1 has a critical role in this process . We review the contribution of several transcription factors to the control of macrophage development Transcription factor LKLF is sufficient to program T cell quiescence via a c - Myc - - dependent pathway . T lymphocytes circulate in a quiescent state until they encounter cognate antigen bound to the surface of an antigen - presenting cell . The molecular pathways that regulate T cell quiescence remain largely unknown . Here we show that forced expression of the lung Kruppel - like transcription factor ( LKLF ) in Jurkat T cells is sufficient to program a quiescent phenotype characterized by decreased proliferation , reduced cell size and protein synthesis and decreased surface expression of activation markers . Conversely , LKLF - deficient peripheral T cells produced by gene targeting showed increased proliferation , increased cell size and enhanced expression of surface activation markers in vivo . LKLF appeared to function , at least in part , by decreasing expression of the proto - oncogene encoding c - Myc . Forced expression of LKLF was associated with markedly decreased c - Myc expression . In addition , many effects of LKLF expression were mimicked by expression of the dominant - negative MadMyc protein and rescued by overexpression of c - Myc . Thus , LKLF is both necessary and sufficient to program quiescence in T cells and functions , in part , by negatively regulating a c - Myc - - dependent pathway . HTLV - 1 p12 ( I ) protein enhances STAT5 activation and decreases the interleukin - 2 requirement for proliferation of primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells . The p12 ( I ) protein , encoded by the pX open reading frame I of the human T - lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV - 1 ) , is a hydrophobic protein that localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi . Although p12 ( I ) contains 4 minimal proline - rich , src homology 3 - binding motifs ( PXXP ) , a characteristic commonly found in proteins involved in signaling pathways , it has not been known whether p12 ( I ) has a role in modulating intracellular signaling pathways . This study demonstrated that p12 ( I ) binds to the cytoplasmic domain of the interleukin - 2 receptor ( IL - 2R ) beta chain that is involved in the recruitment of the Jak1 and Jak3 kinases . As a result of this interaction , p12 ( I ) increases signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 ( STAT5 ) DNA binding and transcriptional activity and this effect depends on the presence of both IL - 2R beta and gamma ( c ) chains and Jak3 . Transduction of primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) with a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 - based retroviral vector expressing p12 ( I ) also resulted in increased STAT5 phosphorylation and DNA binding . However , p12 ( I ) could increase proliferation of human PBMCs only after stimulation of T - cell receptors by treatment of cells with low concentrations of alphaCD3 and alphaCD28 antibodies . In addition , the proliferative advantage of p12 ( I ) - transduced PBMCs was evident mainly at low concentrations of IL - 2 . Together , these data indicate that p12 ( I ) may confer a proliferative advantage on HTLV - 1 - infected cells in the presence of suboptimal antigen stimulation and that this event may account for the clonal proliferation of infected T cells in vivo . ( Blood . 2001 ; 98 : 823 - 829 ) Single dose intranasal administration of retinal autoantigen generates a rapid accumulation and cell activation in draining lymph node and spleen : implications for tolerance therapy . BACKGROUND / AIMS : A single intranasal delivery of retinal autoantigen suppresses effectively experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis ( EAU ) . To further unravel underlying mechanisms the authors wished to determine , firstly , the kinetics of antigen delivery and , secondly , the early cellular responses involved in the initial stages of nasal mucosal tolerance induction . METHODS : Flow cytometry , cell proliferation assays , and microscopy were used to track antigen following a single , intranasal dose of Alexa - 488 labelled retinal antigen . RESULTS : A rapid accumulation of antigen within both superficial cervical lymph nodes ( SCLN ) and spleen was observed after 30 minutes . Significant proliferative responses to IRBP were elicited by 48 hours indicating that systemic priming of naive T cells to retinal antigen had occurred . Cell activation was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation studies , which demonstrated phosphorylation of STAT4 but not STAT6 in both lymph nodes and spleen . However , at 24 hours , STAT4 heterodimerisation with STAT 3 was only observed in spleen . CONCLUSIONS : The results provide novel evidence that following a single intranasal application rapid transfer of antigen occurs . Resulting T cell proliferation develops consequent to differential cell signalling in SCLN and spleen . Further understanding of these underlying cellular mechanisms , in particular as is inferred by the results the contribution of local versus systemic tolerance induction , may assist in strategies to clinically apply mucosal tolerance therapy successfully . Regulation of interleukin ( IL ) - 18 receptor alpha chain expression on CD4 ( + ) T cells during T helper ( Th ) 1 / Th2 differentiation . Critical downregulatory role of IL - 4 . Interleukin ( IL ) - 18 has been well characterized as a costimulatory factor for the induction of IL - 12 - mediated interferon ( IFN ) - gamma production by T helper ( Th ) 1 cells , but also can induce IL - 4 production and thus facilitate the differentiation of Th2 cells . To determine the mechanisms by which IL - 18 might regulate these diametrically distinct immune responses , we have analyzed the role of cytokines in the regulation of IL - 18 receptor alpha chain ( IL - 18Ralpha ) expression . The majority of peripheral CD4 ( + ) T cells constitutively expressed the IL - 18Ralpha . Upon antigen stimulation in the presence of IL - 12 , marked enhancement of IL - 18Ralpha expression was observed . IL - 12 - mediated upregulation of IL - 18Ralpha required IFN - gamma . Activated CD4 ( + ) T cells that expressed low levels of IL - 18Ralpha could produce IFN - gamma when stimulated with the combination of IL - 12 and IL - 18 , while CD4 ( + ) cells which expressed high levels of IL - 18Ralpha could respond to IL - 18 alone . In contrast , T cell stimulation in the presence of IL - 4 resulted in a downregulation of IL - 18Ralpha expression . Both IL - 4 ( - / ) - and signal transducer and activator of transcription ( Stat ) 6 ( - / ) - T cells expressed higher levels of IL - 18Ralpha after TCR stimulation . Furthermore , activated T cells from Stat6 ( - / ) - mice produced more IFN - gamma in response to IL - 18 than wild - type controls . Thus , positive / negative regulation of the IL - 18Ralpha by the major inductive cytokines ( IL - 12 and IL - 4 ) determines the capacity of IL - 18 to polarize an immune response . Glucocorticoid - regulated transcription factors . Glucocorticoids are the most effective antiinflammatory drugs used in the treatment of asthma . They act by binding to a specific receptor ( GR ) that , upon activation , translocates to the nucleus and either increases ( transactivates ) or decreases ( transrepresses ) gene expression . Inhibition of pro - inflammatory transcription factors such as activator protein ( AP ) - 1 , signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STATs ) , nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) and nuclear factor ( NF ) - kappa B is thought to be a major action of glucocorticoids . Acetylation of histones allows unwinding of the local DNA structure and enables RNA polymerase II to enhance gene transcription . Histone acetylation is regulated by a balance between the activity of histone acetyltransferases ( HATs ) and histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) . GR acts as a direct inhibitor of NF - kappa B - induced HAT activity and also by recruiting HDAC2 to the NF - kappa B / HAT complex . A sub - group of patients with glucocorticoid - insensitive asthma have an inability to induce histone acetylation in response to dexamethasone suggesting reduced expression of a GR - specific HAT . This suggests that pharmacological manipulation of specific histone acetylation status is a potentially useful approach for the treatment of inflammatory diseases . Identification of the precise mechanism by which activated GR recruits HDAC2 may reveal new targets for the development of drugs that may dissociate the antiinflammatory actions of glucocorticoids from their side effects that are largely due to gene induction . Copyright Academic Press . Differential ultraviolet - B - induced immunomodulation in XPA , XPC , and CSB DNA repair - deficient mice . Ultraviolet B irradiation has serious consequences for cellular immunity and can suppress the rejection of skin tumors and the resistance to infectious diseases . DNA damage plays a crucial role in these immunomodulatory effects of ultraviolet B , as impaired repair of ultraviolet - B - induced DNA damage has been shown to cause suppression of cellular immunity . Ultraviolet - B - induced DNA damage is repaired by the nucleotide excision repair mechanism very efficiently . Nucleotide excision repair comprises two subpathways : transcription - coupled and global genome repair . In this study the immunologic consequences of specific nucleotide excision repair defects in three mouse models , XPA , XPC , and CSB mutant mice , were investigated . XPA mice carry a total nucleotide excision repair defect , whereas XPC and CSB mice only lack global genome and transcription - coupled nucleotide excision repair , respectively . Our data demonstrate that cellular immune parameters in XPA , XPC , and CSB mice are normal compared with their wild - type ( control ) littermates . This may indicate that the reported altered cellular responses in xeroderma pigmentosum patients are not constitutive but could be due to external factors , such as ultraviolet B . Upon exposure to ultraviolet B , only XPA mice are very sensitive to ultraviolet - B - induced inhibition of Th1 - mediated contact hypersensitivity responses and interferon - gamma production in skin draining lymph nodes . Lipopolysaccharide - stimulated tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin - 10 production are significantly augmented in both XPA and CSB mice after ultraviolet B exposure . Lymph node cell numbers were increased very significantly in XPA , mildly increased in CSB , and not in XPC mice . In general XPC mice do not exhibit any indication of enhanced ultraviolet B susceptibility with regard to the immune parameters analyzed . These data suggest that both global genome repair and transcription - coupled repair are needed to prevent immunomodulation by ultraviolet B , whereas transcription - coupled repair is the major DNA repair subpathway of nucleotide excision repair that prevents the acute ultraviolet - B - induced effects such as erythema . Biomechanical strain induces class a scavenger receptor expression in human monocyte / macrophages and THP - 1 cells : a potential mechanism of increased atherosclerosis in hypertension . BACKGROUND : Although hypertension is an important risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis , the mechanisms for this interaction are incompletely described . Previous studies have suggested that biomechanical strain regulates macrophage phenotype . We tested the hypothesis that biomechanical strain can induce expression of the class A scavenger receptor ( SRA ) , an important lipoprotein receptor in atherogenesis . METHODS AND RESULTS : Human monocyte / macrophages or THP - 1 cells were cultured in a device that imposes uniform biaxial cyclic 1 - Hz strains of 0 % , 1 % , 2 % , or 3 % , and SRA expression was analyzed . Mechanical strains induced SRA mRNA ( 3 . 5 + / - 0 . 6 - fold at 3 % strain for 48 hours , P < 0 . 01 ) and SRA protein in THP - 1 cells in an amplitude - dependent manner . This induction was accompanied by augmented expression of the class B scavenger receptor CD36 ( 2 . 8 + / - 0 . 3 - fold , P < 0 . 001 ) but not by increased peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - gamma expression . To evaluate this effect in vivo , apolipoprotein E ( - / - ) mice were randomly assigned to receive standard chow , a high - cholesterol diet , or a high - cholesterol diet with hypertension induced by angiotensin II infusion for 8 weeks . Immunohistochemistry revealed that among macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions of the aorta , the proportion of macrophages with SRA expression was highest in hypertensive animals on a high - cholesterol diet ( 43 . 9 + / - 0 . 7 % , versus 12 . 0 + / - 2 . 0 % for normotensive animals on a high - cholesterol diet and 4 . 7 + / - 4 . 7 % for animals on standard chow ; P < 0 . 001 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Biomechanical strain induces SRA expression by monocyte / macrophages , suggesting a novel mechanism for promotion of atherosclerosis in hypertensive patients . High glucose induces MCP - 1 expression partly via tyrosine kinase - AP - 1 pathway in peritoneal mesothelial cells . BACKGROUND : High glucose in peritoneal dialysis solutions has been implicated in the pathogenesis of peritoneal fibrosis in chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) patients . However , the mechanisms are not very clear . Peritoneal macrophages seem to participate in the process of peritoneal fibrosis and monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1 ( MCP - 1 ) plays a key role in the recruitment of monocytes toward the peritoneal cavity . However , little is known about the effect of high glucose on MCP - 1 expression and its signal transduction pathway in human peritoneal mesothelial cells . METHODS : Mesothelial cells were cultured with glucose ( 5 to 100 mmol / L ) or mannitol chronically for up to seven days . MCP - 1 expression of mRNA and protein was measured by Northern blot analysis and enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . Chemotactic activity of high - glucose - conditioned culture supernatant was measured by chemotactic assay . To examine the roles of the transcription factors activator protein - 1 ( AP - 1 ) and nuclear factor - kappaB ( NF - kappaB ) , electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) was performed . RESULTS : Glucose induced MCP - 1 mRNA expression in a time - and dose - dependent manner . MCP - 1 protein in cell culture supernant was also increased . Equivalent concentrations of mannitol had no significant effect . High - glucose - conditioned supernatant possessed an increased chemotactic activity for monocytes , which was neutralized by anti - MCP - 1 antibody . EMSA revealed that glucose increased the AP - 1 binding activity in a time - and dose - dependent manner , but not NF - kappaB . Curcumin , an inhibitor of AP - 1 , dose - dependently suppressed the induction of MCP - 1 mRNA by high glucose . Tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as genistein ( 12 . 5 to 50 micromol / L ) and herbimycin A ( 0 . 1 to 1 micromol / L ) inhibited the high - glucose - induced MCP - 1 mRNA expression in a dose - dependent manner , and also suppressed the high - glucose - induced AP - 1 binding activity . CONCLUSIONS : : High glucose induced mesothelial MCP - 1 expression partly via the tyrosine kinase - AP - 1 pathway . Signal thresholds and modular synergy during expression of costimulatory molecules in B lymphocytes . We analyzed intracellular pathways modulating surface densities of CD80 and CD86 in B cells activated through ligation of the Ag receptor , and the adhesion molecule CD54 . Whereas B cell Ag receptor ( BCR ) cross - linking alone stimulated increased expression of CD86 , up - regulation of CD80 required dual stimulation with anti - IgM and anti - CD54 . The principal downstream component contributed by BCR signaling , toward both CD80 and CD86 induction , was the elevated concentration of free cytoplasmic Ca ( 2 + ) , recruited by way of capacitative influx . This alone was sufficient to generate an increase in CD86 levels . However , CD80 enhancement required the concerted action of both intracellular Ca ( 2 + ) concentration and CD54 - initiated pathways . The nexus between anti - IgM and anti - CD54 stimulation , in the context of CD80 regulation , was identified to involve a self - propagating process of sequential synergy . The first step involved amplified accumulation of intracellular cAMP , as a result of cross - talk between BCR - mobilized Ca ( 2 + ) and CD54 - derived signals . This then facilitated a second synergistic interaction between Ca ( 2 + ) and cAMP , culminating in CD80 expression . Our findings of distinct signal transducer requirements , with the added consequences of cross - talk , offers an explanation for variable modulation of costimulatory molecule expression in response to diverse physiological stimuli . Importantly , these results also reveal how concentration threshold barriers for recruitment of individual second messengers can be overcome by constructive convergence of signaling modules . The role of Epstein - Barr virus in neoplastic transformation . In this review , we focus on new data from basic , translational and clinical research relating to the Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) . Beside its well - known tropism for B lymphocytes and epithelial cells , EBV also infects T lymphocytes , monocytes and granulocytes . After primary infection , EBV persists throughout the life span in resting memory B cells , from where it is reactivated upon breakdown of cellular immunity . In the process of neoplastic transformation , the EBV - encoded latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP1 ) oncogene represents the major driving force . LMP1 acts like a constitutively activated receptor of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family and allows the amplification or bypassing of physiological regulatory signals through direct and indirect interactions with proteins of the tumor necrosis factor receptor - associated factor ( TRAF ) family . TRAF2 - mediated NF - kappaB activation , AP - 1 induction and JAK3 / STAT activation may result in sustained proliferation leading to lymphoma . The ability of LMP1 to suppress germinal center formation and its capacity to mediate its own transcriptional activation shed new light on the pathogenesis of EBV - associated latency type II lymphoproliferations like Hodgkin ' s disease and angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy . The carboxy terminus of LMP1 is also a reliable marker for individual EBV strain identification and thus offers new possibilities in tracing the molecular events leading to posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders ( PTLDs ) . Cytotoxic T lymphocytes directed against well - characterized epitopes of EBV latency genes represent an already successful and promising therapeutic approach to EBV - associated lymphomas , in particular PTLDs Interferon - alpha drives T cell - mediated immunopathology in the intestine . The ability of interferon ( IFN ) - alpha to induce autoimmunity and exacerbate Th1 diseases is well known . We have recently described enhanced expression of IFN - alpha in the mucosa of patients with celiac disease ( CD ) , a gluten - sensitive Th1 - mediated enteropathy , characterized by villous atrophy and crypt cell hyperplasia . Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that T cell activation in explant cultures of human fetal gut can also result in villous atrophy and crypt cell hyperplasia . We have , therefore , examined changes that take place in explant cultures of human fetal gut after activation of T cells with anti - CD3 and / or IFN - alpha . We show that activation of T cells with anti - CD3 alone elicits a small IFN - gamma and TNF - alpha response with no tissue injury . Similarly , no changes are seen in explants cultured with IFN - alpha alone . However , addition of IFN - alpha with anti - CD3 results in enhanced Th1 response and crypt cell hyperplasia . This is associated with enhanced phosphorylation of STAT1 , STAT3 , and Fyn , a Src homology tyrosine kinase , which interacts with both TCR and IFN - alpha signal components . Together these data indicate that IFN - alpha can facilitate activation of Th1 - reactive cells in the gut and drive immunopathology . Suppression of tumor necrosis factor alpha production by cAMP in human monocytes : dissociation with mRNA level and independent of interleukin - 10 . BACKGROUND : Elevation of cellular cAMP inhibits lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - stimulated tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - alpha ) production and increases the expression of interleukin ( IL ) - 10 in mononuclear cells . TNF - alpha gene expression obligates activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB ( NF - kappaB ) . Exogenous IL - 10 inhibits NF - kappaB in monocytes and thus attenuates TNF - alpha production . We examined the role of endogenous IL - 10 in the regulation of NF - kappaB activation and TNF - alpha production in human monocytes by cAMP . METHODS : Human monocytes were stimulated with Escherichia coli LPS ( 100 ng / ml ) with and without forskolin ( FSK , 50 microM ) or dibutyryl cyclic AMP ( dbcAMP , 100 microM ) . Cytokine ( TNF - alpha and IL - 10 ) release was measured by immunoassay . TNF - alpha mRNA was measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction , and NF - kappaB DNA binding activity was assessed by gel mobility shift assay . RESULTS : cAMP - elevating agents inhibited LPS - stimulated TNF - alpha release ( 0 . 77 + / - 0 . 13 ng / 10 ( 6 ) cells in LPS + dbcAMP and 0 . 68 + / - 0 . 19 ng / 10 ( 6 ) cells in LPS + FSK , both P < 0 . 05 vs 1 . 61 + / - 0 . 34 ng / 10 ( 6 ) cells in LPS alone ) . Conversely , cAMP enhanced LPS - stimulated IL - 10 release ( 100 + / - 21 . 5 pg / 10 ( 6 ) cells in LPS + dbcAMP and 110 + / - 25 . 2 pg / 10 ( 6 ) cells in LPS + FSK , both P < 0 . 05 vs 53 . 3 + / - 12 . 8 pg / 10 ( 6 ) cells in LPS alone ) . Neither TNF - alpha mRNA expression nor NF - kappaB activation stimulated by LPS was inhibited by the cAMP - elevating agents . Neutralization of IL - 10 with a specific antibody did not attenuate the effect of cAMP - elevating agents on TNF - alpha production . CONCLUSION : The results indicate that cAMP inhibits LPS - stimulated TNF - alpha production through a posttranscriptional mechanism that is independent of endogenous IL - 10 .

BMPs exert a negative growth effect on various types of cells . We have previously reported that BMP - 2 inhibited the growth of HS - 72 mouse hybridoma cells by inducing p21 ( CIP1 / WAF1 ) expression . In the present study , we demonstrated that BMP - 2 activated the mouse p21 ( CIP1 / WAF1 ) promoter in HS - 72 cells , and that a 29 - base pair ( b ) region of the promoter ( - 1928 / - 1900 relative to the TATA box ) , conserved between mice and humans , was responsive to BMP - 2 as well as expression of Smad1 , Smad4 , and constitutively active mutants of BMP type I receptors . Furthermore , an oligonucleotide containing the 29 - b region was found to be associated with Smad4 and phosphorylated Smad1 in the nuclear extract of BMP - 2 - stimulated HS - 72 cells . These results suggested that BMP - 2 might activate p21 ( CIP1 / WAF1 ) transcription by inducing a binding of Smad4 and Smad1 to the 29 - b region in HS - 72 cells . Dendritic cell development from common myeloid progenitors . Dendritic cells ( DCs ) are professional antigen - presenting cells which both initiate adaptive immune responses and control tolerance to self - antigens . It has been suggested that these different effects on responder cells depend on subsets of DCs arising from either myeloid or lymphoid hematopoietic origins . In this model , CD8 alpha + Mac - 1 - DCs are supposed to be of lymphoid while CD8 alpha - Mac - 1 + DCs are supposed to be of myeloid origin . Here we summarize our findings that both CD8 alpha + and CD8 alpha - DCs can arise from clonogenic common myeloid progenitors ( CMPs ) in both thymus and spleen . Therefore CD8 alpha expression DCs does not indicate a lymphoid origin and differences among CD8 alpha + and CD8 alpha - DCs might rather reflect maturation status than ontogeny . On the basis of transplantation studies , it seems likely that most of the DCs in secondary lymphoid organs and a substantial fraction of thymic DCs are myeloid - derived . Macrophage stimulation with Murabutide , an HIV - suppressive muramyl peptide derivative , selectively activates extracellular signal - regulated kinases 1 and 2 , C / EBPbeta and STAT1 : role of CD14 and Toll - like receptors 2 and 4 . The smallest unit of bacterial peptidoglycans known to be endowed with biological activities is muramyl dipeptide ( MDP ) . A clinically acceptable synthetic derivative of MDP , namely murabutide ( MB ) , has been found to present interesting pharmacological properties and to suppress HIV - 1 replication in monocyte - derived macrophages ( MDM ) . We have addressed the signaling events activated in MDM following stimulation with either MB or the potent immunostimulant LPS . We also examined whether signaling by muramyl peptides involves the use of cell surface receptors , including CD14 and Toll - like receptor 2 ( TLR2 ) or TLR4 that are known to be signal - transducing receptors for other bacterial cell wall components . We demonstrate that , unlike LPS , the safe immunomodulator MB selectively activates extracellular signal - regulated kinases ( Erk ) 1 / 2 , in the absence of detectable Jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK ) or p38 mitogen - activated kinase activation . Furthermore , STAT1 activation but weak or no activation of STAT3 or STAT5 respectively , could be detected in MB - stimulated MDM . Using MonoMac6 cells , we observed high C / EBPbeta and AP - 1 but weaker and transient NF - kappaB activation by MB . Moreover , the truncated form of C / EBPbeta , known to repress HIV - 1 transcription , was detected in extracts from MB - treated THP - 1 cells . Surprisingly , neither MB nor MDP were able to transduce signals via CD14 and TLR2 or 4 . These findings present major differences in the early cell activation process between LPS and muramyl peptides , and strongly argue for the implication of co - receptors other than TLR2 and TLR4 in mediating the signaling events induced by defined subunits of bacterial peptidoglycans . Nuclear peroxisome proliferator - activated receptors alpha and gamma have opposing effects on monocyte chemotaxis in endometriosis . The peroxisome proliferator - activated receptors ( PPARs ) alpha and gamma are nuclear receptors that play important roles in inflammatory diseases like ulcerative colitis and arthritis . In this study , we examined the possible role of PPARs in macrophage attraction into the peritoneal cavity of patients with endometriosis . We identified PPAR - alpha and - gamma messenger RNA by RT - PCR and protein by immunoblotting of lysates of peritoneal macrophages and monocytic U937 cells . Using immunocytochemistry , we localized PPAR - alpha and - gamma within the nuclei of both cell types . Monocyte chemotactic activity of peritoneal fluid from patients with endometriosis was quantified in Boyden chambers . Migration of U937 cells was increased by WY 14643 and reduced by rosiglitazone . Peritoneal fluid from patients with endometriosis activated U937 cells transiently transfected with a PPAR - alpha / GAL4 luciferase reporter . By contrast , peritoneal fluid did not cause significant activation of PPAR - gamma / GAL4 constructs . The U937 cells transiently transfected with a PPAR response element luciferase reporter showed disease stage - dependent up - regulation when treated with peritoneal fluid from patients with endometriosis . Treatment with peritoneal fluid from healthy controls down - regulated PPAR response element transactivation . We conclude that peritoneal fluid of endometriosis patients contains activators of PPAR - alpha that stimulate macrophage chemotaxis . Inhibitors of PPAR - alpha or activators of PPAR - gamma could be developed for the treatment of inflammation associated with endometriosis . Long - term - impaired expression of nuclear factor - kappa B and I kappa B alpha in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of trauma patients . Nuclear factor ( NF ) - kappa B expression and dimer characteristics were studied in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) of major - trauma patients and healthy controls . Analysis of PBMCs on days 1 , 3 , 5 , and 10 after trauma revealed that expression of both p65p50 heterodimers and p50p50 homodimers was significantly reduced compared with that in controls . In vitro lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) stimulation of PBMCs induced NF - kappa B translocation . However , throughout the survey , p65p50 activation remained significantly lower in trauma patients than in controls . After LPS stimulation in vitro , the p65p50 / p50p50 ratio was significantly lower in PBMCs from trauma patients than from healthy controls . The ex vivo expression of I kappa B alpha was higher in PBMCs of controls than of trauma patients . LPS did not induce I kappa B expression in PBMCs from trauma patients , but strong induction was obtained with staphylococci , suggesting that this defect is not universal and depends on the nature of the activating signal . Although no direct correlation was found between levels of interleukin - 10 or transforming growth factor - beta and NF - kappa B , these immunosuppressive cytokines were significantly elevated in trauma patients by 10 days after admission . The long - term low - basal and LPS - induced nuclear translocation of NF - kappa B recalled long - term immunoparalysis observed in patients with severe inflammatory stress such as trauma . Hepatic ischemia - reperfusion injury . BACKGROUND : The morbidity associated with liver transplantation and major hepatic resections is partly a result of ischemia - reperfusion injury . DATA SOURCES : The entire world literature on the subject was searched via Medline . Keywords included reperfusion injury , transplantation , liver resection , nitric oxide , endothelin , cytokines , Kupffer cells , ischemic / ischaemic preconditioning , and nuclear factor - kappa B . CONCLUSIONS : An imbalance between endothelin and nitric oxide levels results in failure of the hepatic microcirculation at the onset of reperfusion . Activation of nuclear factor - kappa B in the liver promotes proinflammatory cytokine and adhesion molecule synthesis . These result in oxygen - derived free radical production and neutrophil recruitment , further contributing to cellular injury . Various therapeutic modalities acting on the above mediators have been successfully used to attenuate reperfusion injury in animal models of hepatic transplantation and resection . Application of the knowledge gained from animal models of hepatic ischemia - reperfusion to the clinical setting will improve the outcome of hepatic surgery . Down - regulation of IL - 12 p40 gene in Plasmodium berghei - infected mice . We analyzed the mechanism that causes suppression of IL - 12 p40 gene induction during Plasmodium berghei infection . Although IL - 12 together with IFN - gamma plays an important role in protection against pathogenic infection , the IL - 12 p70 protein production of infected macrophages is lower than that by the uninfected macrophages . We showed in the present study that the induction of IL - 12 p40 gene but not IL - 12 p35 gene in macrophages of P . berghei - infected mice was profoundly inhibited . The inhibition was induced by interaction with macrophages that had contacted with P . berghei - infected erythrocytes and was mediated by a soluble factor , IL - 10 . There was comparable activation of NF - kappaB in uninfected and infected cells . The induction of IFN - regulatory factor - 1 gene was comparable in transcription level in uninfected and infected cells , while the unidentified complex formation of IFN - regulatory factor - 1 was observed in infected cells . Therefore , the inhibition of the IL - 12 p40 gene induction appeared to be regulated at transcriptional regulation level of the gene . The Friend of GATA proteins U - shaped , FOG - 1 , and FOG - 2 function as negative regulators of blood , heart , and eye development in Drosophila . Friend of GATA ( FOG ) proteins regulate GATA factor - activated gene transcription . During vertebrate hematopoiesis , FOG and GATA proteins cooperate to promote erythrocyte and megakaryocyte differentiation . The Drosophila FOG homologue U - shaped ( Ush ) is expressed similarly in the blood cell anlage during embryogenesis . During hematopoiesis , the acute myeloid leukemia 1 homologue Lozenge and Glial cells missing are required for the production of crystal cells and plasmatocytes , respectively . However , additional factors have been predicted to control crystal cell proliferation . In this report , we show that Ush is expressed in hemocyte precursors and plasmatocytes throughout embryogenesis and larval development , and the GATA factor Serpent is essential for Ush embryonic expression . Furthermore , loss of ush function results in an overproduction of crystal cells , whereas forced expression of Ush reduces this cell population . Murine FOG - 1 and FOG - 2 also can repress crystal cell production , but a mutant version of FOG - 2 lacking a conserved motif that binds the corepressor C - terminal binding protein fails to affect the cell lineage . The GATA factor Pannier ( Pnr ) is required for eye and heart development in Drosophila . When Ush , FOG - 1 , FOG - 2 , or mutant FOG - 2 is coexpressed with Pnr during these developmental processes , severe eye and heart phenotypes result , consistent with a conserved negative regulation of Pnr function . These results indicate that the fly and mouse FOG proteins function similarly in three distinct cellular contexts in Drosophila , but may use different mechanisms to regulate genetic events in blood vs . cardial or eye cell lineages The RING finger protein Siah - 1 regulates the level of the transcriptional coactivator OBF - 1 . The transcriptional coactivator OBF - 1 , which interacts with Oct - 1 and Oct - 2 and the octamer site DNA , has been shown to be critical for development of a normal immune response and the formation of germinal centers in secondary lymphoid organs . Here we have identified the RING finger protein Siah - 1 as a protein interacting specifically with OBF - 1 . This interaction is mediated by the C - terminal part of Siah - 1 and by residues in the N - terminus of OBF - 1 , partly distinct from the residues required for formation of a complex with the Oct POU domains and the DNA . Interaction between Siah - 1 and OBF - 1 leads to downregulation of OBF - 1 protein level but not mRNA , and to a corresponding reduction in octamer site - dependent transcription activation . Inhibition of the ubiquitin - proteasome pathway in B cells leads to elevated levels of OBF - 1 protein . Furthermore , in immunized mice , OBF - 1 protein amounts are dramatically increased in primary activated B cells , without concomitant increase in OBF - 1 mRNA . These data suggest that Siah - 1 is part of a novel regulatory loop controlling the level of OBF - 1 protein in B cells . The beta - catenin - - TCF - 1 pathway ensures CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( + ) thymocyte survival . The association of trans - acting T cell factors ( TCFs ) or lymphoid enhancer factor 1 ( LEF - 1 ) with their coactivator beta - catenin mediates transient transcriptional responses to extracellular Wnt signals . We show here that T cell maturation depends on the presence of the beta - catenin - - binding domain in TCF - 1 . This domain is necessary to mediate the survival of immature CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( + ) double - positive ( DP ) thymocytes . Accelerated spontaneous thymocyte death in the absence of TCF - 1 correlates with aberrantly low expression of the anti - apoptotic protein Bcl - x ( L ) . Increasing anti - apoptotic effectors in thymocytes by the use of a Bcl - 2 transgene rescued TCF - 1 - deficient DP thymocytes from apoptosis . Thus , TCF - 1 , upon association with beta - catenin , transiently ensures the survival of immature T cells , which enables them to generate and edit T cell receptor ( TCR ) alpha chains and attempt TCR - mediated positive selection . TRAIL / Apo2L ligand selectively induces apoptosis and overcomes drug resistance in multiple myeloma : therapeutic applications . Multiple myeloma ( MM ) remains incurable and novel treatments are urgently needed . Preclinical in vitro and in vivo evaluations were performed to assess the potential therapeutic applications of human recombinant tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - related apoptosis - inducing ligand / Apo2 ligand ( TRAIL / Apo2L ) in MM . TRAIL / Apo2L potently induced apoptosis of MM cells from patients and the majority of MM cell lines , including cells sensitive or resistant to dexamethasone ( Dex ) , doxorubicin ( Dox ) , melphalan , and mitoxantrone . TRAIL / Apo2L also overcame the survival effect of interleukin 6 on MM cells and did not affect the survival of peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells and purified B cells from healthy donors . The status of the TRAIL receptors ( assessed by immunoblotting and flow cytometry ) could not predict TRAIL sensitivity of MM cells . The anti - MM activity of TRAIL / Apo2L was confirmed in nu / xid / bg mice xenografted with human MM cells ; TRAIL ( 500 microg intraperitoneally daily for 14 days ) was well tolerated and significantly suppressed the growth of plasmacytomas . Dox up - regulated the expression of the TRAIL receptor death receptor 5 ( DR5 ) and synergistically enhanced the effect of TRAIL not only against MM cells sensitive to , but also against those resistant to , Dex - or Dox - induced apoptosis . Nuclear factor ( NF ) - kappaB inhibitors , such as SN50 ( a cell - permeable inhibitor of the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of NF - kappaB ) or the proteasome inhibitor PS - 341 , enhanced the proapoptotic activity of TRAIL / Apo2L against TRAIL - sensitive MM cells , whereas SN50 reversed the TRAIL resistance of ARH - 77 and IM - 9 MM cells . Importantly , normal B lymphocytes were not sensitized to TRAIL by either Dox , SN50 , or PS - 341 . These preclinical studies suggest that TRAIL / Apo2L can overcome conventional drug resistance and provide the basis for clinical trials of TRAIL - based treatment regimens to improve outcome in patients with MM . ( Blood . 2001 ; 98 : 795 - 804 ) CD28 costimulation is required not only to induce IL - 12 receptor but also to render janus kinases / STAT4 responsive to IL - 12 stimulation in TCR - triggered T cells . The activation of resting T cells for the acquisition of various functions depends on whether CD28 costimulatory signals are provided upon T cell receptor stimulation . Here , we investigated how CD28 costimulation functions to allow TCR - triggered resting T cells to acquire IL - 12 responsiveness . When T cells are stimulated with low doses of anti - CD3 mAb , CD28 costimulation was required for the optimal levels of IL - 12 receptor ( IL - 12R ) expression . However , stimulation of T cells with high doses of anti - CD3 alone induced comparable levels of IL - 12R expression to those induced upon CD28 costimulation . Nevertheless , there was a substantial difference in IL - 12 responsiveness between these two groups of T cells : compared to anti - CD28 - costimulated T cells , T cells that were not costimulated with anti - CD28 exhibited decreased levels of Janus kinases ( JAK ) JAK2 / TYK2 and STAT4 phosphorylation and IFN - y production following IL - 12 stimulation . Importantly , STAT6 phosphorylation following IL - 4 stimulation was not decreased in anti - CD28 - uncostimulated T cells . These resutls indicate that CD28 costimulation not only contributes to up - regulating IL - 12R expression but is also required to render JAKs / STAT4 responsive to IL - 12 stimulation . Constitutively activated Akt - 1 is vital for the survival of human monocyte - differentiated macrophages . Role of Mcl - 1 , independent of nuclear factor ( NF ) - kappaB , Bad , or caspase activation . Recent data from mice deficient for phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10 or src homology 2 domain - containing 5 ' inositol phosphatase , phosphatases that negatively regulate the phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) pathway , revealed an increased number of macrophages in these animals , suggesting an essential role for the PI3K pathway for macro - phage survival . Here , we focused on the role of the PI3K - regulated serine / threonine kinase Akt - 1 in modulating macrophage survival . Akt - 1 was constitutively activated in human macrophages and addition of the PI3K inhibitor , LY294002 , suppressed the activation of Akt - 1 and induced cell death . Furthermore , suppression of Akt - 1 by inhibition of PI3K or a dominant negative ( DN ) Akt - 1 resulted in loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential , activation of caspases - 9 and - 3 , and DNA fragmentation . The effects of PI3K inhibition were reversed by the ectopic expression of constitutively activated Akt - 1 or Bcl - x ( L ) . Inhibition of PI3K / Akt - 1 pathway either by LY294002 or DN Akt - 1 had no effect on the constitutive or inducible activation of nuclear factor ( NF ) - kappaB in human macrophages . However , after inhibition of the PI3K / Akt - 1 pathway , a marked decrease in the expression of the antiapoptotic molecule Mcl - 1 , but not other Bcl - 2 family members was observed , and Mcl - 1 rescued macrophages from LY294002 - induced cell death . Further , inhibition of Mcl - 1 by antisense oligonucleotides , also resulted in macrophage apoptosis . Thus , our findings demonstrate that the constitutive activation of Akt - 1 regulates macrophage survival through Mcl - 1 , which is independent of caspases , NF - kappaB , or Bad . GRbeta expression in nasal polyp inflammatory cells and its relationship to the anti - inflammatory effects of intranasal fluticasone . BACKGROUND : Nasal polyposis disease is an inflammatory disorder with intense eosinophilic infiltration of respiratory mucosa that is often difficult to control with topical steroids . Recent evidence suggests that overexpression of the glucocorticoid receptor splice variant GRbeta in inflammatory cells might contribute to steroid insensitivity in diseases such as asthma . OBJECTIVE : The purposes of this investigation were to determine whether nasal polyp ( NP ) inflammatory cells overexpress GRbeta and to examine whether GRbeta overexpression is associated with insensitivity to the potent topical steroid fluticasone propionate ( FP ) . METHODS : Biopsies were obtained from 10 subjects with NPs before and 4 weeks after treatment with intranasal FP . Middle turbinates biopsies from 6 healthy , nonallergic subjects served as normal controls . Biopsies were immunostained for inflammatory cell markers as well as GRbeta and probed for various cytokine mRNA . The anti - inflammatory response to FP was examined in relation to pretreatment levels of GRbeta expression . RESULTS : The total numbers of inflammatory cells were increased in NPs . The percentage of inflammatory cells expressing GRbeta was also increased ( 40 . 5 % + / - 19 . 2 % vs 16 . 1 % + / - 4 . 0 % , P = . 009 ) . GRbeta expression in NPs was almost exclusive to T lymphocytes , eosinophils , and macrophages . An inverse correlation was observed between the baseline inflammatory cell GRbeta expression and the reduction after FP treatment in EG2 - positive eosinophils , CD4 - positive T lymphocytes , endothelial VCAM - 1 expression , and IL - 4 mRNA - positive cells . NPs that were ` ` FP - insensitive ' ' in terms of suppression of eosinophil numbers ( major basic protein - positive ) had a significantly greater percentage of GRbeta - positive inflammatory cells , a higher ratio of GRbeta - positive / GRalpha - positive cells , and increased numbers of GRbeta - positive eosinophils and macrophages in comparison with those that were ` ` FP - sensitive . ' ' ` ` FP - insensitive ' ' NPs also demonstrated a higher percentage of IL - 5 - positive inflammatory cells expressing GRbeta before and after FP treatment . CONCLUSION : GRbeta expression appears to be a marker of steroid insensitivity in NPs . Expression of GRbeta by NP inflammatory cells , particularly T cells and eosinophils , might render them resistant to suppression by topical steroids and thereby contribute to persistent NP inflammation . Transcriptional regulation of galectin - 10 ( eosinophil Charcot - Leyden crystal protein ) : a GC box ( - 44 to - 50 ) controls butyric acid induction of gene expression . Galectin - 10 ( gal - 10 , also known as Charcot - Leyden crystal protein ) is a member of the galectin family of beta - galactoside binding proteins that is expressed uniquely in eosinophilic and basophilic leukocytes . To gain a better understanding of galectin gene expression , we present an analysis of the transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding gal - 10 . Analysis of the minimal promoter revealed nine consensus - binding sites for transcription factors , including several that are also found in the minimal promoters of galectins - 1 , - 2 , and - 3 . The decrease in gal - 10 promoter activity after disruption of either the GC box ( - 44 to - 50 ) or the Oct site ( - 255 to - 261 ) suggests that these sites , along with the previously characterized GATA and EoTF sites , are necessary for full promoter activity . By supershift analysis , we demonstrate binding of the transcription factors Sp1 and Oct1 to the consensus GC box and the Oct site , respectively . Similar to gal - 1 , gal - 10 expression is induced by butyric acid , an effect that is lost upon ablation of the GC box . Additionally , we demonstrate AML3 binding to the consensus AML site and YY1 binding to the Inr sequence , both elements functioning as silencers in the gal - 10 promoter . Tumour - stromal interactions . Role of the stroma in mammary development . Mammary development depends on branching morphogenesis , namely the bifurcation and extension of ductal growth points ( end buds ) and secretory lobules into a more or less fatty stroma . Because breast carcinomas are overwhelmingly ductal in origin , this review focuses on stromal influences guiding postnatal ductal development and there is only the briefest account of the role of embryonic stroma ( mesenchyme ) . The stroma as the necessary target for endocrine mammogens and the source of stimulatory growth factors is described and the importance of mammary epithelium - induced modifications of the periductal stroma is emphasized . Evidence is presented that if they are to grow , end buds must condition proximal fatty stroma by recruiting white blood cells as well as inducing stromal cell division and , possibly , estrogen receptors . The induction of a fibrous stromal tunic around the end bud is described and its likely role as a complex ductal morphogen is discussed ; a possible role in growth inhibition is also considered . Although the signals governing fibrotic induction , ductal morphogenesis , and growth inhibition are unknown , a role for transforming growth factor - beta is highly likely and is discussed . Finally , a need for new conceptual and experimental approaches to understanding stromal - epithelial signaling is discussed . Adipophilin is a sensitive marker for lipid loading in human blood monocytes . Adipophilin , a marker of lipid accumulation initially described in adipocytes , was recently shown to be induced in macrophage foam cells . We found that even freshly isolated blood monocytes express adipophilin and that the amount of adipophilin protein is variable in monocytes from different healthy individuals . However , the physiological expression of adipophilin does not correlate with the levels of free fatty acids , cholesterylesters or free cholesterol . Enzymatically modified low - density lipoprotein ( E - LDL ) induces rapid foam cell formation in monocytes and upregulates adipophilin mRNA and protein within 2 h of incubation . This rapid induction of adipophilin is accompanied by a significant increase of free fatty acids in monocytes incubated with E - LDL . Adipophilin facilitates the uptake of free fatty acids , and here we demonstrate that free fatty acids increase is related to the early upregulation of adipophilin expression in blood monocytes . Fatty acids are ligands for peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - gamma ( PPARgamma ) , and the upregulation of adipophilin mRNA by PPARgamma agonists like 15d - PGJ ( 2 ) and ciglitazone indicates that PPARgamma may mediate the induction of adipophilin expression in human blood monocytes . Constitutive expression of MHC class II genes in melanoma cell lines results from the transcription of class II transactivator abnormally initiated from its B cell - specific promoter . In melanoma cell lines , two different patterns of MHC class II expression have been described , either an IFN gamma - inducible expression of HLA - DR and HLA - DP , with a faint or null expression of HLA - DQ , resembling that described for melanocytes , or a constitutive expression , i . e . , IFN - gamma independent , of all three HLA - D isotypes . As this latter phenotype has been associated with a more rapid progression of melanoma tumors , we have analyzed in different melanoma cell lines the molecular mechanisms leading to this abnormal pattern of MHC class II expression . In agreement with the evidence of a coordinate transcription of the HLA - D genes in these cell lines , we have shown the constitutive expression of CIITA ( class II transactivator ) transcripts , CIITA being known as the master switch of MHC class II expression . Unexpectedly , these transcripts initiate from promoter III of the CIITA gene , a promoter that is mainly used constitutively in B lymphocytes . This expression was further shown to occur through factor ( s ) acting on the enhancer located upstream of CIITA promoter III , which was previously described in epithelioid cells as an IFN - gamma - response sequence . The hypothesis of a general abnormality of the IFN - gamma transduction pathway was dismissed . Constitutive transcription of CIITA from promoter III having been observed in unrelated melanoma cell lines , we propose the hypothesis that this phenomenon might not be a random event , but could be linked to the neoplasic state of the melanoma cells Caspase - mediated calcineurin activation contributes to IL - 2 release during T cell activation . Calcineurin , a Ca ( 2 + ) / calmodulin - dependent Ser / Thr phosphatase ( protein phosphatase 2B ) , plays a critical role in IL - 2 production during T cell activation . It has been previously reported that IL - 2 release in activated Jurkat T requires caspase - like activity ( Posmantur et al . ( 1998 ) Exp . Cell . Res . 244 , 302 - 309 ) . We report here that the 60 - kDa catalytic subunit of calcineurin A ( Cn A ) was partially cleaved to a 45 - kDa form in phytohemagglutinin A ( PHA ) or phorbol ester + ionomycin ( P + I ) - activated Jurkat cells . In parallel , proteolytic activation of upstream caspases ( caspase - 8 and - 9 ) as well as effector caspase - 3 was also observed . Cn A cleavage was caspase mediated , since it was inhibitable by pan - caspase inhibitor Cbz - Asp - CH ( 2 ) OC ( O ) - 2 , 6 - dichlorobenzene ( Z - D - DCB ) . Cn A cleavage was also observed when purified calcineurin was digested in vitro with caspase - 3 . Truncated Cn A was associated with enhanced phosphatase activity and reduced calmodulin sensitivity . Furthermore , in PHA or P + I - activated Jurkat cells , dephosphorylation of calcineurin substrate NFATc ( a transcription factor known to be involved in transactivation of the IL - 2 gene ) , was also suppressed by Z - D - DCB . Taken together , our results suggest that caspase - mediated cleavage of Cn A contributes to IL - 2 production during T cell activation . Copyright 2001 Academic Press . Maturation of human dendritic cells as sulfasalazine target . AIM : Sulfasalazine , a nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug , is effective in treating some autoimmune diseases , but its mechanism of action is unclear . To determine whether dendritic cells could be a possible target of the drug , we studied the effects of sulfasalazine and its metabolites , aminosalicylate and sulfapyridine , on in vitro maturation ( terminal differentiation ) of human myeloid dendritic cells . METHODS : We prepared immature dendritic cells by incubating CD14 - positive cells in the presence of granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor and interleukin ( IL ) - 4 . The cells were matured by addition of tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - a , IL - 1 beta , and prostaglandin E2 in the presence of sulfasalazine or its metabolites - - aminosalicylate and sulfapyridine , or their combinations . We quantified the effect of drugs on the dendritic cell characteristics , such as stimulation of autologous and allogeneic pan - T cell proliferation , surface marker phenotype , IL - 12 p40 subunit secretion , and activation of nuclear transcription factor ( NF ) - kappa B . RESULTS : Dendritic cells treated with sulfasalazine ( 1 . 25 micromol / L or 2 . 5 micromol / L ) could not stimulate T cells ( p < 0 . 028 , two - sided paired t - test ) . In distinction to drug - free maturing dendritic cells , 2 . 5 micromol / L sulfasalazine upregulated the levels of CD14 and CD68 and downregulated the levels of CD40 , CD80 , and CD83 ( for all CD markers , p < 0 . 03 for difference between measurements in the absence and the presence of sulfasalazine ) . From concentration - dependent changes in CD83 expression , we found an apparent ID50 > > 1 . 5 micromol / L sulfasalazine . The apparent ID50 value for aminosalicylate - inhibited maturation was 4 micromol / L . Sulfapyridine had no effect . At 1 . 25 micromol / L , sulfasalazine largely inhibited NF - kB activation in dendritic cells . CONCLUSION : Maturing human dendritic cells are hundred - fold more sensitive to sulfasalazine than T cells and NK cells and the most sensitive human cells described so far . Thus , dendritic cell maturation is an important target of sulfasalazine . Because of the role of dendritic cells in ( auto ) immunity , inhibition of their maturation might provide a target for further optimization of sulfasalazine therapy . Defective function of the proteasome in autoimmunity : involvement of impaired NF - kappaB activation . Type 1 diabetes ( also known as insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus or juvenile - onset diabetes ) is usually caused by T cell - mediated autoimmunity , with a prediabetic state characterized by the production of autoantibodies specific for proteins expressed by pancreatic beta cells . The nonobese patient with diabetes ( NOD ) mouse is a spontaneous model of type 1 diabetes with a strong genetic component that maps to the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) region of the genome . A specific proteasome defect has been identified in NOD mouse in select lymphocytic and monocytic lineages that results from down - regulation of expression of the proteasome subunit LMP2 , which is encoded by a gene in the MHC genomic region . This defect prevents the proteolytic processing required for the production and activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor - kappaB ( NF - kappaB ) , which plays important roles in immune and inflammatory responses , as well as increases the susceptibility of the affected cells to apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF - alpha ) . The novel role of the proteasome in dysfunction in autoimmunity is presented and documented to be both tissue and developmental stage specific . We propose a role of the proteasome as a step in disease pathogenesis and tissue targeting . Down - regulation of TDT transcription in CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( + ) thymocytes by Ikaros proteins in direct competition with an Ets activator . Ikaros is a unique regulator of lymphopoiesis that associates with pericentromeric heterochromatin and has been implicated in heritable gene inactivation . Binding and competition experiments demonstrate that Ikaros dimers compete with an Ets activator for occupancy of the lymphocyte - specific TdT promoter . Mutations that selectively disrupt Ikaros binding to an integrated TdT promoter had no effect on promoter function in a CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( + ) thymocyte line . However , these mutations abolished down - regulation on differentiation , providing evidence that Ikaros plays a direct role in repression . Reduced access to restriction enzyme cleavage suggested that chromatin alterations accompany down - regulation . The Ikaros - dependent down - regulation event and the observed chromatin alterations appear to precede pericentromeric repositioning . Current models propose that the functions of Ikaros should be disrupted by a small isoform that retains the dimerization domain and lacks the DNA - binding domain . Surprisingly , in the CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( + ) thymocyte line , overexpression of a small Ikaros isoform had no effect on differentiation or on the pericentromeric targeting and DNA - binding properties of Ikaros . Rather , the small isoform assembled into multimeric complexes with DNA - bound Ikaros at the pericentromeric foci . The capacity for in vivo multimer formation suggests that interactions between Ikaros dimers bound to the TdT promoter and those bound to pericentromeric repeat sequences may contribute to the pericentromeric repositioning of the inactive gene . Type I interferons and IL - 12 : convergence and cross - regulation among mediators of cellular immunity . Therapeutic use of type I IFN ( IFN - alpha / beta ) has become common . Many of the diverse diseases targeted are marked by pathogenetic abnormalities in cell - mediated immunity ( CMI ) , these cellular immune responses either causing injury to the host , lacking sufficient vigor for virus or tumor clearance , or both . In general , therapeutic efficacy is limited . It is thus notable that the pleiotropic effects of type I IFN on CMI remain poorly understood . We characterized the effects of type I IFN on the production of IL - 12 , the central immunoregulatory cytokine of the CD4 ( + ) T cell arm of CMI . We show that type I IFN are potent inhibitors of IL - 12 production by human monocytes / macrophages . The underlying mechanism involves transcriptional inhibition of the IL - 12p40 gene , marked by down - regulation of PU . 1 binding activity at the upstream Ets site of the IL - 12p40 promoter . Type I IFN have previously been shown to be able to substitute for IL - 12 in driving IFN - gamma production from T and NK cells . The ability of IFN - alpha / beta to suppress IL - 12 production while up - regulating IFN - gamma production suggests a possible mechanistic basis for the difficulties of employing these cytokines in diseases involving abnormalities of CMI . Nuclear factor - kappaB suppressive and inhibitor - kappaB stimulatory effects of troglitazone in obese patients with type 2 diabetes : evidence of an antiinflammatory action ? It has been shown recently that troglitazone exerts an anti - inflammatory effect , in vitro , and in experimental animals . To test these properties in humans , we investigated the effect of troglitazone on the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor - kappaB and its inhibitory protein IkappaB in mononuclear cells ( MNC ) and plasma soluble intracellular adhesion molecule - 1 , monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1 , plasminogen activator inhibitor - 1 , and C - reactive protein . We also examined the effect of troglitazone on reactive oxygen species generation , p47 ( phox ) subunit expression , 9 - hydroxyoctadecadieno acid ( 9 - HODE ) , 13 - HODE , o - tyrosine , and m - tyrosine in obese patients with type 2 diabetes . Seven obese patients with type 2 diabetes were treated with troglitazone ( 400 mg / day ) for 4 weeks . Blood samples were obtained at weekly intervals . Nuclear factor - kappaB binding activity in MNC nuclear extracts was significantly inhibited after troglitazone treatment at week 1 and continued to be inhibited up to week 4 . On the other hand , IkappaB protein levels increased significantly after troglitazone treatment at week 1 , and this increase persisted throughout the study . Plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1 and soluble intracellular adhesion molecule - 1 concentrations did not decrease significantly after troglitazone treatment , although there was a trend toward inhibition . Reactive oxygen species generation by polymorphonuclear cells and MNC , p47 ( phox ) subunit protein quantities , plasminogen activator inhibitor - 1 , and C - reactive protein levels decreased significantly after troglitazone intake . 13 - HODE / linoleic acid and 9 - HODE / linoleic acid ratios also decreased after troglitazone intake . However , o - tyrosine / phenylalanine and m - tyrosine / phenylalanine ratios did not change significantly . These data show that troglitazone has profound antiinflammatory effects in addition to antioxidant effects in obese type 2 diabetics ; these effects may be relevant to the recently described beneficial antiatherosclerotic effects of troglitazone at the vascular level . OX40 stimulation by gp34 / OX40 ligand enhances productive human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection . OX40 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) receptor superfamily and known to be an important costimulatory molecule expressed on activated T cells . To investigate the role of costimulation of OX40 in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) infection by its natural ligand , gp34 , the OX40 - transfected ACH - 2 cell line , ACH - 2 / OX40 , chronically infected with HIV - 1 , was cocultured with paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) - fixed gp34 - transfected mouse cell line , SV - T2 / gp34 . The results showed that HIV - 1 production was strongly induced . This was followed by apparent apoptosis , and both processes were specifically inhibited by the gp34 - specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody 5A8 . Endogenous TNF alpha ( TNF - alpha ) and TNF - beta production were not involved in the enhanced HIV - 1 production . Furthermore , enhanced HIV - 1 transcription in gp34 - stimulated ACH - 2 / OX40 cells was dependent on the kappa B site of the HIV - 1 long terminal repeat , and the OX40 - gp34 interaction activated NF - kappa B consisting of p50 and p65 subunits . When primary activated CD4 ( + ) T cells acutely infected with HIV - 1 ( NL4 - 3 ) ( CXCR4 - using T - cell - line - tropic ) were cocultured with PFA - fixed gp34 ( + ) human T - cell leukemia virus type 1 - bearing MT - 2 cells or SV - T2 / gp34 cells , HIV - 1 production was also markedly enhanced . The enhancement was again significantly inhibited by 5A8 . The present study first shows that OX40 - gp34 interaction stimulates HIV - 1 expression and suggests that OX40 triggering by gp34 may play an important role in enhancing HIV - 1 production in both acutely and latently infected CD4 ( + ) T cells in vivo . Troglitazone , a PPARgamma ligand , inhibits osteopontin gene expression in human monocytes / macrophage THP - 1 cells . Peroxizome proliferator - activated receptor - gamma ( PPARgamma ) is a member of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors that regulate adipocyte differentiation . Recent studies indicate that liganded PPARgamma not only promotes differentiation but also inhibits the activation of macrophages . Osteopontin , a component of extracellular matrix , is synthesized by macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques . In this study , we examined whether PPARgamma ligand regulates osteopontin gene expression in THP - 1 cells , a cell line derived from human monocytic leukemia cells which can differentiate to macrophage upon stimulation with phorbol ester PMA . Northern blot analysis showed that osteopontin expression is markedly induced in response to PMA . Troglitazone , a PPARgamma ligand , dramatically attenuated the PMA - induced osteopontin expression . Transient transfection assays of the human osteopontin promoter / luciferase construct which contains a 5 ' - flanking region between - 1500 and + 87 relative to the transcription start site demonstrate that either treatment with troglitazone or cotransfection of PPARgamma expression vector inhibits osteopontin promoter activity . These data indicate that troglitazone reduces osteopontin gene expression at transcriptional level through PPARgamma activation , and suggest the role of troglitazone in inhibiting the ability of macrophages to produce extracellular matrix , which is particularly relevant to atherosclerotic plaque formation . Transcription factor NF - kappa B regulates Ig lambda light chain gene rearrangement . The tissue - and stage - specific assembly of Ig and TCR genes is mediated by a common V ( D ) J recombinase complex in precursor lymphocytes . Directed alterations in the accessibility of V , D , and J gene segments target the recombinase to specific Ag receptor loci . Accessibility within a given locus is regulated by the functional interaction of transcription factors with cognate enhancer elements and correlates with the transcriptional activity of unrearranged gene segments . As demonstrated in our prior studies , rearrangement of the Igkappa locus is regulated by the inducible transcription factor NF - kappaB . In contrast to the Igkappa locus , known transcriptional control elements in the Iglambda locus lack functional NF - kappaB binding sites . Consistent with this observation , the expression of assembled Iglambda genes in mature B cells has been shown to be NF - kappaB independent . Nonetheless , we now show that specific repression of NF - kappaB inhibits germline transcription and recombination of Iglambda gene segments in precursor B cells . Molecular analyses indicate that the block in NF - kappaB impairs Iglambda rearrangement at the level of recombinase accessibility . In contrast , the activities of known Iglambda promoter and enhancer elements are unaffected in the same cellular background . These findings expand the range of NF - kappaB action in precursor B cells beyond Igkappa to include the control of recombinational accessibility at both L chain loci . Moreover , our results strongly suggest the existence of a novel Iglambda regulatory element that is either directly or indirectly activated by NF - kappaB during the early stages of B cell development . Transcription factor STAT5A is a substrate of Bruton ' s tyrosine kinase in B cells . STAT5A is a molecular regulator of proliferation , differentiation , and apoptosis in lymphohematopoietic cells . Here we show that STAT5A can serve as a functional substrate of Bruton ' s tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) . Purified recombinant BTK was capable of directly binding purified recombinant STAT5A with high affinity ( K ( d ) = 44 nm ) , as determined by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore biosensor system . BTK was also capable of tyrosine - phosphorylating ectopically expressed recombinant STAT5A on Tyr ( 694 ) both in vitro and in vivo in a Janus kinase 3 - independent fashion . BTK phosphorylated the Y665F , Y668F , and Y682F , Y683F mutants but not the Y694F mutant of STAT5A . STAT5A mutations in the Src homology 2 ( SH2 ) and SH3 domains did not alter the BTK - mediated tyrosine phosphorylation . Recombinant BTK proteins with mutant pleckstrin homology , SH2 , or SH3 domains were capable of phosphorylating STAT5A , whereas recombinant BTK proteins with SH1 / kinase domain mutations were not . In pull - down experiments , only full - length BTK and its SH1 / kinase domain ( but not the pleckstrin homology , SH2 , or SH3 domains ) were capable of binding STAT5A . Ectopically expressed BTK kinase domain was capable of tyrosine - phosphorylating STAT5A both in vitro and in vivo . BTK - mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of ectopically expressed wild type ( but not Tyr ( 694 ) mutant ) STAT5A enhanced its DNA binding activity . In BTK - competent chicken B cells , anti - IgM - stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 protein was prevented by pretreatment with the BTK inhibitor LFM - A13 but not by pretreatment with the JAK3 inhibitor HI - P131 . B cell antigen receptor ligation resulted in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 in BTK - deficient chicken B cells reconstituted with wild type human BTK but not in BTK - deficient chicken B cells reconstituted with kinase - inactive mutant BTK . Similarly , anti - IgM stimulation resulted in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5A in BTK - competent B cells from wild type mice but not in BTK - deficient B cells from XID mice . In contrast to B cells from XID mice , B cells from JAK3 knockout mice showed a normal STAT5A phosphorylation response to anti - IgM stimulation . These findings provide unprecedented experimental evidence that BTK plays a nonredundant and pivotal role in B cell antigen receptor - mediated STAT5A activation in B cells Role of T - bet in commitment of TH1 cells before IL - 12 - dependent selection . How cytokines control differentiation of helper T ( TH ) cells is controversial . We show that T - bet , without apparent assistance from interleukin 12 ( IL - 12 ) / STAT4 , specifies TH1 effector fate by targeting chromatin remodeling to individual interferon - gamma ( IFN - gamma ) alleles and by inducing IL - 12 receptor beta2 expression . Subsequently , it appears that IL - 12 / STAT4 serves two essential functions in the development of TH1 cells : as growth signal , inducing survival and cell division ; and as trans - activator , prolonging IFN - gamma synthesis through a genetic interaction with the coactivator , CREB - binding protein . These results suggest that a cytokine does not simply induce TH fate choice but instead may act as an essential secondary stimulus that mediates selective survival of a lineage . Stat6 is necessary and sufficient for IL - 4 ' s role in Th2 differentiation and cell expansion . IL - 4 plays a critical role in the differentiation of T CR - stimulated naive CD4 T cells to the Th2 phenotype . In response to IL - 4 , the IL - 4R activates a set of phosphotyrosine binding domain - containing proteins , including insulin receptor substrate 1 / 2 , Shc , and IL - 4R interacting protein , as well as Stat6 . Stat6 has been shown to be required for Th2 differentiation . To determine the roles of the phosphotyrosine binding adaptors in Th2 differentiation , we prepared a retrovirus containing a mutant of the human ( h ) IL - 4R alpha - chain , Y497F , which is unable to recruit these adaptors . The mutant hIL - 4Ralpha , as well as the wild - type ( WT ) hIL - 4Ralpha , was introduced into naive CD4 T cells . Upon hIL - 4 stimulation , Y497F worked as well as the WT hIL - 4Ralpha in driving Th2 differentiation , as measured by Gata3 up - regulation and IL - 4 production . Furthermore , IL - 4 - driven cell expansion was also normal in the cells infected with Y497F , although cells infected with Y497F were not capable of phosphorylating insulin receptor substrate 2 . These results suggest that the signal pathway mediated by Y497 is dispensable for both IL - 4 - driven Th2 differentiation and cell expansion . Both WT and Y497F hIL - 4Ralpha lose the ability to drive Th2 differentiation and cell expansion in Stat6 - knockout CD4 T cells . A constitutively activated form of Stat6 introduced into CD4 T cells resulted in both Th2 differentiation and enhanced cell expansion . Thus , activated Stat6 is necessary and sufficient to mediate both IL - 4 - driven Th2 differentiation and cell expansion in CD4 T cells . The effect of HIV - 1 regulatory proteins on cellular genes : derepression of the IL - 2 promoter by Tat . In HIV - infected individuals dysregulation of the immune system is characterized by severe disorders of the cytokine network . Increase secretion of IL - 2 , the major T cell growth and differentiation cytokine , may play a decisive role in sensitization of T cells for activation induced apoptosis and indirect death of activated T cells through augmented virus replication . We investigated the cause of enhanced IL - 2 secretion and found that the HIV Tat induces this effect . We demonstrate that increased IL - 2 secretion is due to Tat - enhanced IL - 2 promoter activation . Tat derepresses and activates the distal AP - 1 site ( position - 185 to - 177 ) in the IL - 2 promoter . In nonstimulated T cells a repressor complex containing NF - IL6 , JunB , c - Fos and Fra - 1 is formed on the AP - 1 ( IL - 2 / d ) site and represses IL - 2 promoter activity . After T cell activation , a heterodimeric activator containing p65 and c - Jun binds to the AP - 1 ( IL - 2 / d ) site . HIV Tat enhances activation of NF - kappaB and consequently , activates the AP - 1 ( IL - 2 / d ) site . Our data provide evidence for a novel mechanism by which HIV Tat dysregulates IL - 2 production and therefore may contribute to the HIV - 1 infection in a way yet to be clarified . Transforming growth factor - beta1 interferes with thrombopoietin - induced signal transduction in megakaryoblastic and erythroleukemic cells . OBJECTIVE : Thrombopoietin ( TPO ) and transforming growth factor - beta ( 1 ) ( TGF - beta ( 1 ) ) have been shown to exert opposite effects on proliferation and megakaryocytic differentiation of hematopoietic cells . To determine whether TGF - beta ( 1 ) interferes directly with TPO - induced signal transduction in hematopoietic cells , we compared the regulatory effects in the TPO - responsive cell lines Mo - 7e and HEL . MATERIALS AND METHODS : The cells were stimulated by 100 ng / mL TPO and / or 100 ng / mL TGF - beta1 and analyzed for proliferation ( 3H thymidine incorporation ) , viability ( trypan blue exclusion ) , and protein expression and phosphorylation ( Western blot ) . RESULTS : TPO enhanced the proliferation of Mo - 7e cells as determined by 3H - thymidine incorporation , whereas TGF - beta1 suppressed baseline cell growth and antagonized the proliferative effect of TPO . TPO - induced proliferation also was reduced by a specific inhibitor of the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway ( PD098059 ) , which inhibits activation of the MAPK extracellular signal - regulated kinases ( ERK ) ERK1 and ERK2 , and AG490 , an inhibitor of Janus kinase - 2 , which completely blocked TPO - induced proliferation . As demonstrated by Western blotting , TGF - beta1 reduced the TPO - stimulated ERK1 / ERK2 and STAT5 phosphorylation in Mo - 7e and HEL cells . This effect was completely reversed by preincubation with a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor ( Na3VO4 ) , which suggests that TGF - beta1 activated a phosphatase . Although STAT3 also was activated by TPO , STAT3 activation remained unaltered by TGF - beta1 . CONCLUSION : Taken together , these data suggest that TGF - beta1 modulates TPO - mediated effects on megakaryocytic proliferation by interfering with TPO - induced signal transduction , particularly by reducing the activities of MAPK ERK1 / ERK2 and STAT5 . Invariant chain induces B cell maturation by activating a TAF ( II ) 105 - NF - kappaB - dependent transcription program . Early stages of B cell development occur in the bone marrow , resulting in formation of immature B cells . From there these immature cells migrate to the spleen where they differentiate to mature cells . This final maturation step is crucial for the B cells to become responsive to antigens and to participate in the immune response . Recently , invariant chain ( Ii ) , a major histocompatibility complex class II chaperone , as well as the transcription factors c - Rel and p65 / RelA , were found to play a role in the final antigen - independent differentiation stage of B cells in the spleen . In this study , we investigated a possible link between Ii - dependent B cell maturation and the NF - kappaB pathway . Our studies indicate that Ii - induced B cell maturation involves activation of transcription mediated by the NF - kappaB p65 / RelA homodimer and requires the B cell - enriched coactivator TBP - associated factor ( II ) 105 . Androgens indirectly accelerate thymocyte apoptosis . Apoptotic processes , or the disturbance of the natural regulation of these processes , may be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases ( AID ) . Women are , in general , more susceptible than men to develop AID like rheumatoid arthritis . Androgens and glucocorticoids , in contrast to oestrogens , have favourable effects in AID models as well as in human AID . It is known that glucocorticoids ( GC ) , used for treatment of AID , increase apoptosis in the thymus resulting in decreased numbers of CD4 + CD8 + thymocytes . It was asked whether androgens , in contrast to oestrogens , exert their favourable effects in the treatment of AID by a mechanism comparable to that described for GC by eliminating the apoptosis prone CD4 + CD8 + population in the thymus . Although both androgens and oestrogens proved thymolytic , a significantly decreased percentage of CD4 + CD8 + thymocytes was observed by flow cytometry after treatment of mice with the androgen methyltestosterone , but not with the oestrogen ethinylestradiol . To investigate whether the observed thymolytic effects were due to the presence of hormone receptors on thymocytes , cells were isolated from the thymus and incubated with androgens or oestrogens to measure apoptosis . Several techniques were used to determine thymocyte apoptosis in vitro , but no enhanced apoptotic signal was observed . Using the very sensitive TUNEL assay , no direct effect of androgens on thymocytes in vitro could be observed . This is in sharp contrast to the high signal observed with GC . Therefore , upon in vivo androgen treatment , other cells containing androgen receptors than thymocytes are probably involved in inducing the increase in thymic apoptosis . To study the role of the androgen receptor on thymocyte apoptosis , androgen receptor mutant ( Tfm / Y ) mice were treated with androgens . No alterations of thymocyte subpopulations were seen , suggesting that changes in the percentage of CD4 + CD8 + thymocytes after administration of androgens depend on the presence of functional androgen receptors . Thus , it is concluded that androgens indirectly accelerate thymocyte apoptosis in vivo . Inhibition of the transcription factors AP - 1 and NF - kappaB in CD4 T cells by peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma ligands . The peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma ( PPARgamma ) , a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily , is essential for adipocyte differentiation and glucose homeostasis . PPARgamma has been found recently to regulate macrophage activation in response to mitogens and inflammation . Our study shows PPARgamma to be preferentially expressed in the nuclei of resting T cells and to increase upon activation of T cells by either anti - CD3 and anti - CD28 or phorbol myristyl acetate ( PMA ) . We also found the PPARgamma ligand ciglitizone to attenuate the activation of T cells by inhibiting cytokine gene expression and anti - CD3 and anti - CD28 or PMA - induced proliferative responses . Inhibition of both the proliferative response and inflammatory cytokine expression in CD4 T cells was correlated with suppression of the activated transcription factors AP1 and NF - kappaB . PPARgamma ligands also strongly inhibited SEA - induced Vbeta3 T cell activation in vivo . These results , together with previous findings of the inhibitory effect of PPARgamma ligands on activated macrophages , provide clear evidence for PPARgamma as a negative regulator of the inflammatory activation of both macrophage and T cells . PPARgamma may thus be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of autoimmunity . A prominent role for activator protein - 1 in the transcription of the human 2B4 ( CD244 ) gene in NK cells . The cell surface glycoprotein 2B4 ( CD244 ) of the Ig superfamily is involved in the regulation of NK and T lymphocyte functions . We have recently identified CD48 as the high affinity counterreceptor for 2B4 in both mice and humans . The cytoplasmic domain of 2B4 associates with src homology 2 domain - containing protein or signaling lymphocyte activation molecule - associated protein , whose mutation is the underlying genetic defect in the X - linked lymphoproliferative syndrome . In this study , we report the molecular cloning and characterization of the human 2B4 ( h2B4 ) promoter . Through primer extension analysis , we found that the transcription of the h2B4 gene initiates at multiple start sites . We isolated h2B4 genomic clones and PCR amplified the 5 ' untranslated region containing the promoter elements . We have identified a functional AP - 1 site that lies between ( - 106 to - 100 ) through transient transfection analysis in YT cells , a human NK cell line . EMSAs with Abs specific for various protein factors of the AP - 1 family revealed that multiple members of the Jun family are involved in the regulation of the h2B4 gene . Mutation of the AP - 1 site not only abolishes protein / DNA interactions but also promoter activity . These results demonstrate a significant role for AP - 1 in the transcriptional regulation of the h2B4 gene . Functional correction of FA - C cells with FANCC suppresses the expression of interferon gamma - inducible genes . Because hematopoietic cells derived from Fanconi anemia ( FA ) patients of the C - complementation group ( FA - C ) are hypersensitive to the inhibitory effects of interferon gamma ( IFNgamma ) , the products of certain IFNgamma - inducible genes known to influence hematopoietic cell survival were quantified . High constitutive expression of the IFNgamma - inducible genes , IFN - stimulated gene factor 3 gamma subunit ( ISGF3gamma ) , IFN regulatory factor - 1 ( IRF - 1 ) , and the cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor p21 ( WAF1 ) was found in FANCC mutant B lymphoblasts , low - density bone marrow cells , and murine embryonic fibroblasts . Paradoxically , these cells do not activate signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) 1 properly . In an attempt to clarify mechanisms by which FA - C cells overexpress IFNgamma - inducible genes in the face of defective STAT1 phosphorylation , it was reasoned that decreased levels of activated STAT1 might result in reduced expression of a hematopoietic IFNgamma - responsive protein that normally modulates expression of other IFNgamma - responsive genes . Levels of the IFNgamma - inducible factor IFN consensus sequence binding protein ( ICSBP ) , a negative trans - acting regulator of some IFNgamma - inducible genes , were quantified . ICSBP levels were reduced in FA - C B lymphoblasts and MEFs . However , enforced expression of ICSBP failed to down - regulate IRF - 1 , ISGF3gamma , and p21 ( WAF1 ) . Thus , the FANCC protein functions to modulate expression of a family of genes that in normal cells are inducible only by specific environmental cues for apoptosis or mitogenic inhibition , but it does so independently of the classic IFN - STAT1 pathway and is not the direct result of reduced ICSBP expression . A genetic investigation of E2A function in lymphocyte development . Lymphocytes are derived from hematopoietic stem cells ( HSC ) following a series of regulated differentiation events . Multipotent HSCs become committed to the B cell lineage in bone marrow and the T cell lineage in the thymus after receiving appropriate signals from the corresponding microenvironment . These committed lymphoid cells must then undergo V ( D ) J recombination at the immunoglobulin gene or T cell receptor gene locus resulting in clonal production of functional B or T lymphocytes , respectively . Lymphocyte commitment and differentiation are accompanied by programmed gene expression or repression events which are driven by lineage and stage specific transcription factors . The basic - helix - loop - helix ( bHLH ) transcription factors encoded by the E2A gene are involved in several differentiation events during B and T cell development , including lineage commitment , initiation of V ( D ) J recombination , and antigen receptor mediated proliferation and differentiation . Several recent reviews have provided a comprehensive discussion of biochemical , cellular , and genetic research on E2A function in lymphocyte development ( 1 , 2 ) . Here , we only discuss some of the genetic approaches our laboratory ( except where it is noted ) has undertaken to investigate the molecular pathways mediated by E2A transcription factors in lymphocyte development D609 inhibits ionizing radiation - induced oxidative damage by acting as a potent antioxidant . Tricyclodecan - 9 - yl - xanthogenate ( D609 ) has been extensively studied in biological systems and exhibits a variety of biological functions , including antiviral , antitumor , and anti - inflammatory activities . Most of these activities have been largely attributed to the inhibitory effect of D609 on phosphatidylcholine - specific phospholipase C . However , as a xanthate derivative , D609 is a strong electrolyte and readily dissociates to xanthate anions and cations of alkali metals in solution . Xanthate anions and protonated xanthic acid contain a free thiol moiety and are highly reductive . This implies that D609 and other xanthate derivatives may function as potent antioxidants . Indeed , we found that D609 inhibited the Fenton reaction - induced oxidation of dihydrorhodamine 123 in a dose - dependent manner similar to that of pyrrolidinedithiocar , a well known antioxidant . In addition , D609 inhibited the formation of the alpha - phenyl - tert - butylnitrone - free radical spin adducts and lipid peroxidation of synaptosomal membranes by the Fenton reagents . Furthermore , preincubation of lymphocytes with D609 resulted in a significant diminution of ionizing radiation ( IR ) - induced 1 ) production of reactive oxygen species ; 2 ) decrease in intracellular reduced glutathione ; 3 ) oxidative damage to proteins and lipids ; and 4 ) activation of nuclear factor - kappaB . Moreover , when D609 ( 50 mg / kg i . v . ) was administered to mice 10 min prior to total body IR ( 6 . 5 and 8 . 5 Gy ) , it protected the mice from IR - induced lethality . Thus , these results indicate that D609 is a potent antioxidant and has the ability to inhibit IR - induced cellular oxidative stress . Inhibition of AP - 1 by the glucocorticoid - inducible protein GILZ . The immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids arise largely by inhibition of cytokine gene expression , which has been ascribed to interference between the glucocorticoid receptor and transcription factors such as AP - 1 and NF - kappa B as well as by competition for common coactivators . Here we show that glucocorticoid - induced inhibition of interleukin - 2 mRNA expression in activated normal T cells required new protein synthesis , suggesting that this phenomenon is secondary to expression of glucocorticoid - regulated genes . One of the most prominent glucocorticoid - induced genes is glucocorticoid - induced leucine zipper ( GILZ ) , which has been reported to inhibit activation - induced up - regulation of Fas ligand ( FasL ) mRNA . Indeed , transient expression of GILZ in Jurkat T cells blocked induction of a reporter construct driven by the FasL promoter . This could be accounted for by GILZ - mediated inhibition of Egr - 2 and Egr - 3 , NFAT / AP - 1 - inducible transcription factors that bind a regulatory element in the FasL promoter and up - regulate FasL expression . GILZ also potently inhibited AP - 1 - driven and IL - 2 promoter - driven reporter constructs , and recombinant GILZ specifically interacted with c - Fos and c - Jun in vitro and inhibited the binding of active AP - 1 to its target DNA . Whereas homodimerization of GILZ required the presence of its leucine zipper , the interaction with c - Fos and c - Jun occurred through the N - terminal 60 - amino acid region of GILZ . Thus , GILZ represents a glucocorticoid - induced gene product that can inhibit a variety of activation - induced events , at least in part by direct interference with AP - 1 , and is therefore a candidate for a mediator of glucocorticoid - induced immunosuppression . Pharmacokinetic differences between a T cell - tolerizing and a T cell - activating peptide . Vaccination with a peptide representing a CTL epitope from the human papillomavirus ( HPV ) 16 E7 protein induces a specific CTL response that prevents the outgrowth of HPV16 E7 - expressing tumors . In contrast , vaccination with a peptide encoding an adenovirus type 5 ( Ad5 ) E1A CTL epitope results in CTL tolerance and enhanced growth of an Ad5 E1A - expressing tumor . It is unclear why these peptides induce such opposite effects . To determine whether a difference in pharmacokinetics can explain the functional contrasts , tritiated Ad5 E1A and HPV16 E7 peptides were injected into mice . Results show that the tolerizing peptide spread through the body 16 times faster than the activating peptide and was cleared at least 2 times faster . The HPV16 E7 peptide kinetics correlated with the kinetics of HPV16 E7 - specific CTL induction . In contrast , Ad5 E1A peptide injection resulted in physical deletion of preexisting Ad5 E1A - specific CTLs within 24 h after injection . This tolerization occurred at the time when the peptide reached its maximum peptide concentration in the organs . These data suggest that ubiquitous expression of the tolerizing Ad5 E1A peptide within a short period of time causes activation - induced cell death of Ad5 E1A - specific CTLs . Therefore , information on the pharmacokinetics of peptides is vital for the safety and efficacy of peptide - based vaccines . Smad3 and Smad4 mediate transforming growth factor - beta1 - induced IgA expression in murine B lymphocytes . Transforming growth factor ( TGF ) - beta1 is well established as a critical IgA isotype switching factor and Smad molecules have been reported to act as transducers and transcriptional factors in the expression of TGF - beta1 - targeted genes . We examined the involvement of Smad proteins in TGF - beta1 - induced IgA expression . First , we found that TGF - beta1 significantly increases endogenous germ - line ( GL ) alpha transcripts by LPS - stimulated CH12 . LX . 4933 ( mu ( + ) ) B lymphoma cells . To investigate its signaling mechanisms , the lymphoma cell line was transfected with pFL3 that contains the TGF - beta - responsive element of the GLalpha promoter , and stimulated with TGF - beta1 . Similar to endogenous GLalpha transcripts , TGF - beta1 induces GLalpha promoter activity and overexpression of Smad3 markedly enhances the promoter activity . This activity is further augmented by cotransfected Smad4 . On the other hand , Smad7 substantially abrogates the synergistic effect of Smad3 / 4 on GLalpha promoter activity . In addition , overexpression of Smad3 / 4 enhances TGF - beta1 - induced endogenous GLalpha transcripts in normal spleen B cell s . Finally , in the presence of TGF - beta1 , overexpression of Smad3 / 4 selectively increases both surface IgA expression and IgA production . The results from the present study indicate that Smad3 , Smad4 , and Smad7 , at least in part , serve as mediators linking TGF - beta1 to transcriptional regulation of IgA switching related gene and regulation of IgA class switching . The translesion DNA polymerase zeta plays a major role in Ig and bcl - 6 somatic hypermutation . Ig somatic mutations would be introduced by a polymerase ( pol ) while repairing DNA outside main DNA replication . We show that human B cells constitutively express the translesion pol zeta , which effectively extends DNA past mismatched bases ( mispair extender ) , and pol eta , which bypasses DNA lesions in an error - free fashion . Upon B cell receptor ( BCR ) engagement and coculture with activated CD4 + T cells , these lymphocytes upregulated pol zeta , downregulated pol eta , and mutated the Ig and bcl - 6 genes . Inhibition of the pol zeta REV3 catalytic subunit by specific phosphorothioate - modified oligonucleotides impaired Ig and bcl - 6 hypermutation and UV damage - induced DNA mutagenesis , without affecting cell cycle or viability . Thus , pol zeta plays a critical role in Ig and bcl - 6 hypermutation , perhaps facilitated by the downregulation of pol eta . Molecular mechanism of cell cycle progression induced by the oncogene product Tax of human T - cell leukemia virus type I . The trans - activator protein Tax of human T - cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV - I ) plays an important role in the development of adult T - cell leukemia through , at least in part , its ability to stimulate cell growth . We previously reported that Tax induced cell cycle progression from G0 / G1 phase to S and G2 / M phases in human T - cell line Kit 225 cells . To elucidate molecular mechanism of Tax - induced cell cycle progression , we systematically examined the effects of Tax on biochemical events associated with cell cycle progression . Introduction of Tax into resting Kit 225 cells induced activation of the G1 / S transition regulation cascade consisting of activation of cyclin dependent kinase 2 ( CDK2 ) and CDK4 , phosphorylation of the Rb family proteins and an increase in free E2F . The kinase activation was found to result from Tax - induced expression of genes for cell cycle regulatory molecules including cyclin D2 , cyclin E , E2F1 , CDK2 , CDK4 and CDK6 , and Tax - induced reduction of CDK inhibitors p19 ( INK4d ) and p27 ( Kip1 ) . These modulations by Tax always paralleled the ability of Tax to activate the NF - kappaB transcription pathway . These results indicate the important role of Tax - mediated trans - activation of the genes for cell cycle regulatory molecules in Tax - induced cell cycle progression . Cot kinase induces cyclooxygenase - 2 expression in T cells through activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells . Cyclooxygenase - 2 ( COX - 2 ) is induced in human T lymphocytes upon T cell receptor triggering . Here we report that Cot kinase , a mitogen - activated protein kinase kinase kinase involved in T cell activation , up - regulates COX - 2 gene expression in Jurkat T cells . Induction of COX - 2 promoter activity by Cot kinase occurred mainly through activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) . Mutation of the distal ( - 105 / - 97 ) and proximal ( - 76 / - 61 ) NFAT response elements in the COX - 2 promoter abolished the activation induced by Cot kinase . Even more , coexpression of a dominant negative version of NFAT inhibited Cot kinase - mediated COX - 2 promoter activation , whereas cotransfection of a constitutively active version of the calcium - dependent phosphatase calcineurin synergizes with Cot kinase in the up - regulation of COX - 2 promoter - driven transcription . Strikingly , Cot kinase increased transactivation mediated by a GAL4 - NFAT fusion protein containing the N - terminal transactivation domain of NFATp . In contrast to phorbol ester plus calcium ionophore A23187 , Cot kinase increases both COX - 2 promoter activity and NFAT - mediated transactivation in a cyclosporin A - independent manner . These data indicate that Cot kinase up - regulates COX - 2 promoter - driven transcription through the NFAT response elements , being the Cot kinase - induced NFAT - dependent transactivation presumably implicated in this up - regulation . Positive and negative roles of the trans - acting T cell factor - 1 for the acquisition of distinct Ly - 49 MHC class I receptors by NK cells . Members of the Ly - 49 gene family code for class I MHC - specific receptors that regulate NK cell function . Due to a combinatorial distribution of Ly - 49 receptors , NK cells display considerable clonal heterogeneity . The acquisition of one Ly - 49 receptor , Ly - 49A is strictly dependent on the transcriptional trans - acting factor T cell - specific factor - 1 ( TCF - 1 ) . Indeed , TCF - 1 binds to two sites in the Ly - 49a promoter and regulates its activity , suggesting that the Ly - 49a gene is a direct TCF - 1 target . TCF - 1 deficiency resulted in the altered usage of additional Ly - 49 receptors . We show in this study , using TCF - 1 beta ( 2 ) - microglobulin double - deficient mice , that these repertoire alterations are not due to Ly - 49 / MHC class I interactions . Our findings rather suggest a TCF - 1 - dependent , cell autonomous effect on the acquisition of multiple Ly - 49 receptors . Besides reduced receptor usage ( Ly - 49A and D ) , we also observed no effect ( Ly - 49C ) and significantly expanded ( Ly - 49G and I ) receptor usage in the absence of TCF - 1 . These effects did not in all cases correlate with the presence of TCF binding sites in the respective proximal promoter . Therefore , besides TCF - 1 binding to the proximal promoter , Ly - 49 acquisition may also be regulated by TCF - 1 binding to more distant cis - acting elements and / or by regulating the expression of additional trans - acting factors . Consistent with the observed differential , positive or negative role of TCF - 1 for Ly - 49 receptor acquisition , reporter gene assays revealed the presence of an inducing as well as a repressing TCF site in certain proximal Ly - 49 promoters . These findings reveal an important role of TCF - 1 for the formation of the NK cell receptor repertoire . Ligation of CD11b and CD11c beta ( 2 ) integrins by antibodies or soluble CD23 induces macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha ( MIP - 1alpha ) and MIP - 1beta production in primary human monocytes through a pathway dependent on nuclear factor - kappaB . Chemokines and adhesion molecules such as integrins play a major part in the trafficking , extravasation , and recruitment of leukocytes to inflammatory sites . This study investigated the effects of beta ( 2 ) integrin engagement on chemokine production by freshly isolated human monocytes . We found that ligation of CD11b or CD11c but not CD11a alpha chains of beta ( 2 ) integrins by antibodies or soluble CD23 ( sCD23 ) fusion proteins rapidly induced transcription and secretion of interleukin 8 , macrophage inflammatory protein ( MIP ) 1alpha , and MIP - 1beta . Because the promoters of these chemokine genes contain kappaB binding sites , we assessed the possible role of nuclear factor - kappaB ( NF - kappaB ) in controlling induction of the genes through beta ( 2 ) integrin engagement . Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that sCD23 or antibodies to CD11b or to CD11c up - regulated DNA - binding activity of NF - kappaB . Activation of NF - kappaB was accompanied by degradation of its cytosolic inhibitor IkappaB - alpha . Blockade of depletion of IkappaB - alpha by proteasome inhibitors ( proteasome inhibitor I or acetyl - leucinyl - leucinyl - norleucinal ) led to concomitant inhibition of NF - kappaB DNA - binding activity and expression of MIP - 1alpha and MIP - 1beta messenger RNA induced by beta ( 2 ) integrin ligation . These results suggest that triggering of CD11b or CD11c beta ( 2 ) integrin on primary human monocytes provides activation signals leading to nuclear translocation of NF - kappaB and subsequent secretion of MIP - 1alpha and MIP - 1beta that may have an important role in recruitment of other inflammatory cells during initiation of an inflammatory response Synergistic transcriptional activation of human Acyl - coenzyme A : cholesterol acyltransterase - 1 gene by interferon - gamma and all - trans - retinoic acid THP - 1 cells . Acyl - coenzyme A : cholesterol acyltransferase ( ACAT ) is an intracellular enzyme involved in cellular cholesterol homeostasis and in atherosclerotic foam cell formation . Human ACAT - 1 gene contains two promoters ( P1 and P7 ) , each located in a different chromosome ( 1 and 7 ) ( Li , B . L . , Li , X . L . , Duan , Z . J . , Lee , O . , Lin , S . , Ma , Z . M . , Chang , C . C . , Yang , X . Y . , Park , J . P . , Mohandas , T . K . , Noll , W . , Chan , L . , and Chang , T . Y . ( 1999 ) J . Biol Chem . 274 , 11060 - 11071 ) . Interferon - gamma ( IFN - gamma ) , a cytokine that exerts many pro - atherosclerotic effects in vivo , causes up - regulation of ACAT - 1 mRNA in human blood monocyte - derived macrophages and macrophage - like cells but not in other cell types . To examine the molecular nature of this observation , we identified within the ACAT - 1 P1 promoter a 159 - base pair core region . This region contains 4 Sp1 elements and an IFN - gamma activated sequence ( GAS ) that overlaps with the second Sp1 element . In the monocytic cell line THP - 1 cell , the combination of IFN - gamma and all - trans - retinoic acid ( a known differentiation agent ) enhances the ACAT - 1 P1 promoter but not the P7 promoter . Additional experiments showed that all - trans - retinoic acid causes large induction of the transcription factor STAT1 , while IFN - gamma causes activation of STAT1 such that it binds to the GAS / Sp1 site in the ACAT - 1 P1 promoter . Our work provides a molecular mechanism to account for the effect of IFN - gamma in causing transcriptional activation of ACAT - 1 in macrophage - like cells . Inhaled nitric oxide down - regulates intrapulmonary nitric oxide production in lipopolysaccharide - induced acute lung injury . OBJECTIVE : To examine whether inhaled nitric oxide ( NO ) affected the intrapulmonary production of NO , reactive oxygen species , and nuclear factor - kappaB in a lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - induced model of acute lung injury . DESIGN : Prospective , randomized , laboratory study . SETTING : Experimental laboratory at a biomedical institute . SUBJECTS : Twenty male rabbits weighing 2 . 5 - 3 . 5 kg . INTERVENTIONS : Saline or LPS ( 5 mg / kg of body weight ) was administered intravenously with or without NO inhalation ( 10 ppm ) in each group of five rabbits . MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : LPS increased the lung leak index , the neutrophils and NO levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid , and NO levels produced by resting and stimulated alveolar macrophages . Inhaled NO decreased the lung leak index , the neutrophils and NO levels as measured by nitrite levels in the lavage fluid , and NO produced by the resting and stimulated alveolar macrophages . Inhaled NO also blocked the activities of reactive oxygen species and nuclear factor - kappaB binding to DNA in lavage cells and in alveolar macrophages . CONCLUSION : Inhaled NO attenuates LPS - induced acute lung injury , possibly by decreasing NO production in the lungs . The mechanism of reducing NO production resulting from inhaled NO may involve , in part , the activities of reactive oxygen species and / or nuclear factor - kappaB . Treatment of allergic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness by antisense - induced local blockade of GATA - 3 expression . Recent studies in transgenic mice have revealed that expression of a dominant negative form of the transcription factor GATA - 3 in T cells can prevent T helper cell type 2 ( Th2 ) - mediated allergic airway inflammation in mice . However , it remains unclear whether GATA - 3 plays a role in the effector phase of allergic airway inflammation and whether antagonizing the expression and / or function of GATA - 3 can be used for the therapy of allergic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness . Here , we analyzed the effects of locally antagonizing GATA - 3 function in a murine model of asthma . We could suppress GATA - 3 expression in interleukin ( IL ) - 4 - producing T cells in vitro and in vivo by an antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide overlapping the translation start site of GATA - 3 , whereas nonsense control oligonucleotides were virtually inactive . In a murine model of asthma associated with allergic pulmonary inflammation and hyperresponsiveness in ovalbumin ( OVA ) - sensitized mice , local intranasal administration of fluorescein isothiocyanate - labeled GATA - 3 antisense oligonucleotides led to DNA uptake in lung cells associated with a reduction of intracellular GATA - 3 expression . Such intrapulmonary blockade of GATA - 3 expression caused an abrogation of signs of lung inflammation including infiltration of eosinophils and Th2 cytokine production . Furthermore , treatment with antisense but not nonsense oligonucleotides induced a significant reduction of airway hyperresponsiveness in OVA - sensitized mice to levels comparable to saline - treated control mice , as assessed by both enhanced pause ( PenH ) responses and pulmonary resistance determined by body plethysmography . These data indicate a critical role for GATA - 3 in the effector phase of a murine asthma model and suggest that local delivery of GATA - 3 antisense oligonucleotides may be a novel approach for the treatment of airway hyperresponsiveness such as in asthma . This approach has the potential advantage of suppressing the expression of various proinflammatory Th2 cytokines simultaneously rather than suppressing the activity of a single cytokine . T helper - cell phenotype regulates atherosclerosis in mice under conditions of mild hypercholesterolemia . BACKGROUND : T cells are implicated in atherosclerosis , but little is known about the genetic control or molecular pathways , especially under conditions of mild hypercholesterolemia . METHODS AND RESULTS : BALB / c mice , making a CD4 + Th2 ( IL - 4 + ) cell response , express both MHC class II antigens ( IA ( d ) , IE ( d ) ) and are atherosclerosis - resistant . C57Bl / 6 mice produce a CD4 + Th1 ( interferon [ IFN ] gamma + ) response , express IA ( b ) but no IE , and are atherosclerosis - prone . To evaluate T helper - cell phenotype in fatty streak formation , wild - type C57Bl / 6 mice ( IA ( b ) + IE - ) and transgenic mice , either AB ( o ) , IA ( b ) - IE - ; ABEalpha , IA - IE ( k ) + ; or BL : TG : Ealpha , IA ( b ) + IE ( k ) + , were fed a high - cholesterol diet for 16 weeks and evaluated histomorphometricall for aortic lesions . Lesion size in AB ( o ) , ABEalpha , and BL : TG : Ealpha strains was decreased by 54 % , 79 % , and 82 % , respectively , compared with wild - type , correlating with decreased Th1 and increased Th2 expression and suggesting that T helper - cell phenotype is important in fatty lesion development . Decreasing Th1 cells by antibodies ( alpha - CD4 ) or cytokines ( IL - 4 ) also caused > / = 80 % reductions in lesion size . Immunohistology revealed IFN - gamma , but not IL - 4 , colocalized with activated macrophages . Confirming these findings in a different mouse strain , BALB / c Stat 6 knockout mice ( Th2 cell - deficient ) developed aortic lesions comparable to C57Bl / 6 mice on the same diet . CONCLUSIONS : In mildly hypercholesterolemic C57Bl / 6 mice , presence of IA ( b ) and absence of IE regulated CD4 + T helper - cell phenotype ; fatty lesions were proportional to IFNgamma + Th1 cells in both C57Bl / 6 and BALB / c strains . IFN - gamma may participate through macrophage activation , whereas IL - 4 may act to limit Th1 - cell response . Requirement for p38 and p44 / p42 mitogen - activated protein kinases in RAGE - mediated nuclear factor - kappaB transcriptional activation and cytokine secretion . Advanced glycation end product ( AGE ) activation of the signal - transducing receptor for AGE ( RAGE ) has been linked to a proinflammatory phenotypic change within cells . However , the precise intracellular signaling pathways involved have not been elucidated . We demonstrate here that human serum albumin modified with N ( varepsilon ) - ( carboxymethyl ) lysine ( CML ) , a major AGE adduct that progressively accumulates with aging , diabetes , and renal failure , induced nuclear factor ( NF ) - kappaB - driven reporter gene expression in human monocytic THP - 1 cells . The NF - kappaB response was blocked with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the putative ligand - binding domain of RAGE , with anti - RAGE antiserum , and by coexpression of truncated receptors lacking the intracellular domain . Signal transduction from RAGE to NF - kappaB involved the generation of reactive oxygen species , since reporter gene expression was blocked with the antioxidant N - acetyl - L - cysteine . CML - modified albumin produced rapid transient activation of tyrosine phosphorylation , extracellular signal - regulated kinase 1 and 2 , and p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) , but not c - Jun NH ( 2 ) - terminal kinase . RAGE - mediated NF - kappaB activation was suppressed by the selective p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 and by coexpression of a kinase - dead p38 dominant - negative mutant . Activation of NF - kappaB by CML - modified albumin increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines ( tumor necrosis factor - alpha , interleukin - 1beta , and monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1 ) severalfold , and inhibition of p38 MAPK blocked these increases . These results indicate that p38 MAPK activation mediates RAGE - induced NF - kappaB - dependent secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and suggest that accelerated inflammation may be a consequence of cellular activation induced by this receptor . Antigen - receptor cross - linking and lipopolysaccharide trigger distinct phosphoinositide 3 - kinase - dependent pathways to NF - kappa B activation in primary B cells . The NF - kappaB / Rel transcription factors play an important role in the expression of genes involved in B cell development , differentiation and function . Nuclear NF - kappaB is induced in B cells by engagement of either the BCR or CD40 or by stimulation with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . Despite the importance of NF - kappaB to B cell function , little is known about the signaling pathways leading to NF - kappaB activation . In this report we address the role of phosphoinositide 3 ' - kinase ( PI 3 - kinase ) in BCR - and LPS - induced NF - kappaB activation using populations of primary murine resting B cells . Using the specific pharmacological inhibitors of PI 3 - kinase , Wortmannin and LY294002 , we demonstrate that PI 3 - kinase activity is vital for BCR - induced NF - kappaB DNA - binding activity . Furthermore , we show that this is achieved via protein kinase C - dependent degradation of IkappaBalpha . Similar analyses reveal that PI 3 - kinase is also critical in triggering NF - kappaB DNA - binding activity and IkappaBalpha degradation following LPS stimulation . Interestingly , a PKC inhibitor which blocked the BCR - induced IkappaBalpha degradation had no effect on the degradation of IkappaBalpha after LPS stimulation . Taken together , our results indicate the involvement of PI 3 - kinase in at least two distinct signaling pathways leading to activation of NF - kappaB in B cells . Tetramer - guided epitope mapping : rapid identification and characterization of immunodominant CD4 + T cell epitopes from complex antigens . T cell responses to Ags involve recognition of selected peptide epitopes contained within the antigenic protein . In this report , we describe a new approach for direct identification of CD4 + T cell epitopes of complex Ags that uses human class II tetramers to identify reactive cells . With a panel of 60 overlapping peptides covering the entire sequence of the VP16 protein , a major Ag for HSV - 2 , we generated a panel of class II MHC tetramers loaded with peptide pools that were used to stain peripheral lymphocytes of an HSV - 2 infected individual . With this approach , we identified four new DRA1 * 0101 / DRB1 * 0401 - and two DRA1 * 0101 / DRB1 * 0404 - restricted , VP16 - specific epitopes . By using tetramers to sort individual cells , we easily obtained a large number of clones specific to these epitopes . Although DRA1 * 0101 / DRB1 * 0401 and DRA1 * 0101 / DRB1 * 0404 are structurally very similar , nonoverlapping VP16 epitopes were identified , illustrating high selectivity of individual allele polymorphisms within common MHC variants . This rapid approach to detecting CD4 + T cell epitopes from complex Ags can be applied to any known Ag that gives a T cell response . Localized pancreatic NF - kappaB activation and inflammatory response in taurocholate - induced pancreatitis . Transcription factor nuclear factor - kappaB ( NF - kappaB ) is activated in cerulein pancreatitis and mediates cytokine expression . The role of transcription factor activation in other models of pancreatitis has not been established . Here we report upregulation of NF - kappaB and inflammatory molecules , and their correlation with local pancreatic injury , in a model of severe pancreatitis . Rats received intraductal infusion of taurocholate or saline , and the pancreatic head and tail were analyzed separately . NF - kappaB and activator protein - 1 ( AP - 1 ) activation were assessed by gel shift assay , and mRNA expression of interleukin - 6 , tumor necrosis factor - alpha , KC , monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1 , and inducible nitric oxide synthase was assessed by semiquantitative RT - PCR . Morphological damage and trypsin activation were much greater in the pancreatic head than tail , in parallel with a stronger activation of NF - kappaB and cytokine mRNA . Saline infusion mildly affected these parameters . AP - 1 was strongly activated in both pancreatic segments after either taurocholate or saline infusion . NF - kappaB inhibition with N - acetylcysteine ameliorated the local inflammatory response . Correlation between localized NF - kappaB activation , cytokine upregulation , and tissue damage suggests a key role for NF - kappaB in the development of the inflammatory response of acute pancreatitis . CD45 tyrosine phosphatase controls common gamma - chain cytokine - mediated STAT and extracellular signal - related kinase phosphorylation in activated human lymphoblasts : inhibition of proliferation without induction of apoptosis . The objective of this study was to test whether CD45 signals can influence signaling processes in activated human lymphoblasts . To this end , we generated lymphoblasts which proliferate in response to common gamma - chain cytokines , but readily undergo apoptosis after cytokine withdrawal . In experiments with the CD45R0 mAb UCHL - 1 , but not control CD45 mAbs , we found significant inhibition of proliferation . Interestingly , the pan - CD45 mAb GAP8 . 3 , which is most effective in inhibition of OKT - 3 - mediated proliferation in quiescent lymphocytes , was ineffective in lymphoblasts . Addition of CD3 mAb OKT - 3 had no influence on IL - 2 - mediated proliferation ( with or without UCHL - 1 ) . In contrast , after addition of OKT - 3 to IL - 4 - and IL - 7 - stimulated proliferation assays , UCHL - 1 signals could not significantly alter cellular proliferation . We did not find induction of apoptosis following CD45R0 signaling . In Western blots using mAbs detecting phosphorylated STAT - 3 , STAT - 5 , STAT - 6 , or extracellular signal - related kinase 1 / 2 , we found that CD45R0 signaling could effectively diminish phosphorylation of these intracellular signaling components . Using RT - PCR , we found that CD45R0 signaling inhibited IL - 2 mRNA production without major influence on IL - 13 , IL - 5 , or IFN - gamma mRNA levels . Costimulation with OKT - 3 and IL - 2 optimally induced secretion of IFN - gamma , TNF - alpha , and IL - 5 , which was not decreased by CD45 signals . In conclusion , we illustrate that CD45R0 signals control early cytokine receptor - associated signaling processes and mRNA and DNA synthesis in activated human lymphoblasts . Furthermore , we show the existence of CD45 epitopes ( GAP8 . 3 ) , which are active and critical for signaling in quiescent lymphocytes , but are nonfunctional in activated human lymphoblasts . Pax5 determines the identity of B cells from the beginning to the end of B - lymphopoiesis . Despite being one of the most intensively studied cell types , the molecular basis of B cell specification is largely unknown . The Pax5 gene encoding the transcription factor BSAP is required for progression of B - lymphopoiesis beyond the pro - B cell stage . Pax5 - deficient pro - B cells are , however , not yet committed to the B - lymphoid lineage , but instead have a broad lymphomyeloid developmental potential . Pax5 appears to mediate B - lineage commitment by repressing the transcription of non - B - lymphoid genes and by simultaneously activating the expression of B - lineage - specific genes . Pax5 thus functions both as a transcriptional repressor and activator , depending on its interactions with corepressors of the Groucho protein family or with positive regulators such as the TATA - binding protein . Once committed to the B - lineage , B cells require Pax5 function to maintain their B - lymphoid identity throughout B cell development Partners in transcription : NFAT and AP - 1 . Combinatorial regulation is a powerful mechanism that enables tight control of gene expression , via integration of multiple signaling pathways that induce different transcription factors required for enhanceosome assembly . The four calcium - regulated transcription factors of the NFAT family act synergistically with AP - 1 ( Fos / Jun ) proteins on composite DNA elements which contain adjacent NFAT and AP - 1 binding sites , where they form highly stable ternary complexes to regulate the expression of diverse inducible genes . Concomitant induction of NFAT and AP - 1 requires concerted activation of two different signaling pathways : calcium / calcineurin , which promotes NFAT dephosphorylation , nuclear translocation and activation ; and protein kinase C ( PKC ) / Ras , which promotes the synthesis , phosphorylation and activation of members of the Fos and Jun families of transcription factors . A fifth member of the NFAT family , NFAT5 , controls the cellular response to osmotic stress , by a mechanism that requires dimer formation and is independent of calcineurin or of interaction with AP - 1 . Pharmacological interference with theNFAT : AP - 1 interaction may be useful in selective manipulation of the immune response . Balanced activation of NFAT and AP - 1 is known to be required for productive immune responses , but the role of NFAT : AP - 1 interactions in other cell types and biological processes remains to be understood . Cytokine production by Vgamma ( + ) - T - cell subsets is an important factor determining CD4 ( + ) - Th - cell phenotype and susceptibility of BALB / c mice to coxsackievirus B3 - induced myocarditis . Two coxsackievirus B3 ( CVB3 ) variants ( H3 and H310A1 ) differ by a single amino acid mutation in the VP2 capsid protein . H3 induces severe myocarditis in BALB / c mice , but H310A1 is amyocarditic . Infection with H3 , but not H310A1 , preferentially activates Vgamma4 Vdelta4 cells , which are strongly positive for gamma interferon ( IFN - gamma ) , whereas Vgamma1 Vdelta4 cells are increased in both H3 and H310A1 virus - infected animals . Depletion of Vgamma1 ( + ) cells using monoclonal anti - Vgamma1 antibody enhanced myocarditis and CD4 ( + ) - , IFN - gamma ( + ) - cell responses in both H3 - and H310A1 - infected mice yet decreased the CD4 ( + ) - , IL - 4 ( + ) - cell response . Depleting Vgamma4 ( + ) cells suppressed myocarditis and reduced CD4 ( + ) IFN - gamma ( + ) cells but increased CD4 ( + ) IL - 4 ( + ) T cells . The role of cytokine production by Vgamma1 ( + ) and Vgamma4 ( + ) T cells was investigated by adoptively transferring these cells isolated from H3 - infected BALB / c Stat4 knockout ( Stat4ko ) ( defective in IFN - gamma expression ) or BALB / c Stat6ko ( defective in IL - 4 expression ) mice into H3 virus - infected wild - type BALB / c recipients . Vgamma4 and Vgamma1 ( + ) T cells from Stat4ko mice expressed IL - 4 but no or minimal IFN - gamma , whereas these cell populations derived from Stat6ko mice expressed IFN - gamma but no IL - 4 . Stat4ko Vgamma1 ( + ) cells ( IL - 4 ( + ) ) suppress myocarditis . Stat6ko Vgamma1 ( + ) cells ( IFN - gamma ( + ) ) were not inhibitory . Stat6ko Vgamma4 ( + ) cells ( IFN - gamma ( + ) ) significantly enhanced myocarditis . Stat4ko Vgamma4 ( + ) cells ( IL - 4 ( + ) ) neither inhibited nor enhanced disease . These results show that distinct gammadelta - T - cell subsets control myocarditis susceptibility and bias the CD4 ( + ) - Th - cell response . The cytokines produced by the Vgamma subpopulation have a significant influence on the CD4 ( + ) - Th - cell phenotype . Plasmin - induced expression of cytokines and tissue factor in human monocytes involves AP - 1 and IKKbeta - mediated NF - kappaB activation . It was previously shown that plasmin activates human peripheral monocytes in terms of lipid mediator release and chemotactic migration . Here it is demonstrated that plasmin induces proinflammatory cytokine release and tissue factor ( TF ) expression by monocytes . Plasmin 0 . 043 to 1 . 43 CTA U / mL , but not active site - blocked plasmin , triggered concentration - dependent expression of mRNA for interleukin - 1alpha ( IL - 1alpha ) , IL - 1beta , tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF - alpha ) , and TF with maximum responses after 4 hours . Plasmin - mediated mRNA expression was inhibited in a concentration - dependent manner by the lysine analogue trans - 4 - ( aminomethyl ) cyclohexane - 1 - carboxylic acid ( t - AMCA ) . Increases in mRNA levels were followed by concentration - and time - dependent release of IL - 1alpha , IL - 1beta and TNF - alpha and by TF expression on monocyte surfaces . Neither cytokines nor TF could be detected when monocytes were preincubated with actinomycin D or cycloheximide . Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated plasmin - induced activation of NF - kappaB ; DNA - binding complexes were composed of p50 , p65 , and c - Rel , as shown by supershift experiments . Nuclear translocation of NF - kappaB / Rel proteins coincided with IkappaBalpha degradation . At variance with endotoxic lipopolysaccharide , plasmin elicited the rapid degradation of another cytoplasmic NF - kappaB inhibitor , p105 . Proteolysis of NF - kappaB inhibitors was apparently due to transient activation of IkappaB kinase ( IKK ) beta that reached maximum activity at 1 hour after plasmin stimulation . In addition , AP - 1 binding was increased in plasmin - treated monocytes , with most complexes composed of JunD , c - Fos , and FosB . These findings further substantiate the role of plasmin as a proinflammatory activator of human monocytes and reveal an important new link between the plasminogen - plasmin system and inflammation . ( Blood . 2001 ; 97 : 3941 - 3950 ) STAT3 is constitutively active in some patients with Polycythemia rubra vera . OBJECTIVE : Polycythemia vera is a clonal stem cell disorder characterized by hyperproliferation of the erythroid , myeloid , and megakaryocytic lineages . While it has been shown that progenitor cells of P . vera patients are hypersensitive to several growth factors including erythropoietin , insulin - like growth factor - 1 , thrombopoietin , interleukin - 3 , and granulocyte / monocyte colony - stimulating factor , the molecular pathogenesis of this disease remains unknown . Growth factor hypersensitivity could be mediated by changes in signal transduction pathways . We therefore investigated a common downstream effector of cytokines , the signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STATs ) . A constitutive activation of STAT factors could explain the increased proliferation of P . vera cells even in the absence of growth factor stimulation . METHODS : Peripheral granulocytes from patients with P . vera and from healthy volunteers were assayed for STAT1 , 3 , and 5 DNA binding by electrophoretic mobility shift assay . RESULTS : Four of 14 P . vera patients analyzed showed constitutive STAT3 DNA binding in unstimulated peripheral granulocytes , while none of the 17 healthy volunteers tested did . None of the subjects showed constitutive STAT1 or STAT5 activity . Western blotting demonstrated that , in the three patients , STAT3 is constitutively phosphorylated on Tyr 705 , whereas it is unphosphorylated in the other patients and in controls . Interestingly , constitutive STAT3 activity did not correlate with the duration of disease or the treatment regimen . It was observed in a recently diagnosed patient and in two patients treated only with phlebotomy . CONCLUSION : Our data suggest that constitutive phosphorylation and activation of STAT3 is not a secondary event induced by mutagenizing agents or by prolonged hyperproliferation of hematopoietic cells , but rather represents a primary molecular aberration . Constitutively active STAT3 may contribute to the growth factor hypersensitivity of P . vera cells . Identification of phosphorylation sites for Bruton ' s tyrosine kinase within the transcriptional regulator BAP / TFII - I . Bruton ' s tyrosine kinase ( Btk ) , a member of the Tec family of cytosolic kinases , is essential for B cell development and function . BAP / TFII - I , a protein implicated in transcriptional regulation , is associated with Btk in B cells and is transiently phosphorylated on tyrosine following B cell receptor engagement . BAP / TFII - I is a substrate for Btk in vitro and is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine upon coexpression with Btk in mammalian cells . In an effort to understand the physiologic consequences of BAP / TFII - I tyrosine phosphorylation following B cell receptor stimulation , site - directed mutagenesis and phosphopeptide mapping were used to locate the predominant sites of BAP / TFII - I phosphorylation by Btk in vitro . These residues , Tyr248 , Tyr357 , and Tyr462 , were also found to be the major sites for Btk - dependent phosphorylation of BAP / TFII - I in vivo . Residues Tyr357 and Tyr462 are contained within the loop regions of adjacent helix - loop - helix - like repeats within BAP / TFII - I . Mutation of either Tyr248 , Tyr357 , or Tyr462 to phenylalanine reduced transcription from a c - fos promoter relative to wild - type BAP / TFII - I in transfected COS - 7 cells , consistent with the interpretation that phosphorylation at these sites contributes to transcriptional activation . Phosphorylation of BAP / TFII - I by Btk may link engagement of receptors such as surface immunoglobulin to modulation of gene expression . Expression of interferon consensus sequence binding protein induces potent immunity against BCR / ABL - induced leukemia . Mice deficient in the interferon consensus sequence binding protein ( ICSBP ) develop a disease resembling chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) , which in humans is caused by the BCR / ABL oncoprotein . Interferon - alpha ( IFN - alpha ) induces ICSBP expression and is an effective therapy for CML . This study examined whether enforced expression of ICSBP might antagonize BCR / ABL - induced leukemia ; results demonstrated that ICSBP - modified cells generated a protective CD8 ( + ) cytotoxic T - cell response against BCR / ABL - transformed BaF3 cells in a murine leukemia model . ICSBP expression represents a novel means of stimulating a host immune response to BCR / ABL ( + ) leukemia cells and a potential strategy for immunotherapy of CML . ( Blood . 2001 ; 97 : 3491 - 3497 ) A transcriptional block in the IL - 2 promoter at the - 150 AP - 1 site in effector CD8 + T cells . Both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells that produce IL - 2 in response to Ag recognition have been isolated . However , most effector CD8 + T cells recovered after exposure to Ag do not produce sufficient IL - 2 to sustain growth , and depend on CD4 + T helper cells for this obligate growth factor . IL - 2 expression in CD4 + T cells is primarily controlled at the level of transcription , but mechanisms restricting IL - 2 production in CD8 + T cells have not been elucidated . To evaluate transcriptional regulation of the IL - 2 gene in CD8 + T cells , we stably transfected reporter genes into Ag - specific CD8 + T cell clones . CD28 + CD8 ( + ) T cells unable to transcribe the IL - 2 gene in response to antigenic stimulation had a block in transactivation of the - 150 CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) / AP - 1 site of the IL - 2 promoter , but did transactivate the composite NFAT / AP - 1 and OCT / AP - 1 sites , and a consensus AP - 1 motif . Mutation of the nonconsensus - 150 AP - 1 site to a consensus AP - 1 site , or insertion of a CD28RE / AP - 1 consensus site upstream of the native - 150 CD28RE / AP - 1 site restored transactivation of the altered promoter . These results suggest that the defect at the - 150 site may reflect the absence or inactivity of a required factor rather than repression of the IL - 2 promoter . Stem cell factor and interleukin - 3 induce stepwise generation of erythroid precursor cells from a basic fibroblast growth factor - dependent hematopoietic stem cell line , A - 6 . A m ultipotent immature myeloid cell population was produced from a basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) - dependent hematopoietic stem cell line , A - 6 , when cultured with stem cell factor ( SCF ) replacing bFGF . Those cells were positive for stem cell markers , c - kit and CD34 , and a myeloid cell marker , F4 / 80 . Some cell fractions were also positive for Mac - 1 , a macrophage marker or Gr - 1 , a granulocytic maker , but negative for an erythroid marker TER119 . They also showed the expression of mRNA for the myeloid - specific PU . 1 but did not that for the erythroid - specific GATA - 1 . Among various cytokines , interleukin - 3 ( IL - 3 ) induced erythroid precursor cells that expressed the erythroid - specific GATA - 1 and beta - major globin . The quantitative analysis showed that erythroid precursor cells were newly produced from the immature myeloid cells by cultivation with IL - 3 . SCF and IL - 3 induced stepwise generation of erythroid precursor cells from an A - 6 hematopoietic stem cell line . Copyright 2001 Academic Press . Distinct BMI - 1 and EZH2 expression patterns in thymocytes and mature T cells suggest a role for Polycomb genes in human T cell differentiation . BMI - 1 and EZH2 Polycomb - group ( PcG ) proteins belong to two distinct protein complexes involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis . Using unique PcG - specific antisera and triple immunofluorescence , we found that mature resting peripheral T cells expressed BMI - 1 , whereas dividing blasts were EZH2 ( + ) . By contrast , subcapsular immature double - negative ( DN ) ( CD4 ( - ) / CD8 ( - ) ) T cells in the thymus coexpressed BMI - 1 and EZH2 or were BMI - 1 single positive . Their descendants , double - positive ( DP ; CD4 ( + ) / CD8 ( + ) ) cortical thymocytes , expressed EZH2 without BMI - 1 . Most EZH2 ( + ) DN and DP thymocytes were dividing , while DN BMI - 1 ( + ) / EZH2 ( - ) thymocytes were resting and proliferation was occasionally noted in DN BMI - 1 ( + ) / EZH2 ( + ) cells . Maturation of DP cortical thymocytes to single - positive ( CD4 ( + ) / CD8 ( - ) or CD8 ( + ) / CD4 ( - ) ) medullar thymocytes correlated with decreased detectability of EZH2 and continued relative absence of BMI - 1 . Our data show that BMI - 1 and EZH2 expression in mature peripheral T cells is mutually exclusive and linked to proliferation status , and that this pattern is not yet established in thymocytes of the cortex and medulla . T cell stage - specific PcG expression profiles suggest that PcG genes contribute to regulation of T cell differentiation . They probably reflect stabilization of cell type - specific gene expression and irreversibility of lineage choice . The difference in PcG expression between medullar thymocytes and mature interfollicular T cells indicates that additional maturation processes occur after thymocyte transportation from the thymus . Stepwise lineage restriction of progenitors in lympho - myelopoiesis . It has long been controversial whether hematopoiesis progresses through ordered stages of determination as in embryonic development . This is due to the absence of a methodology capable of exactly determining the developmental potential of hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells . The multilineage progenitor ( MLP ) assay enabled us to discriminate among seven types of hematopoietic progenitors , which are multipotent progenitor p - MTB ( capable of generating myeloid , T and B cells ) , bipotent progenitors p - MT , p - MB and p - TB , and unipotent progenitors p - M , p - T and p - B . Among these seven types , the p - TB type progenitor was found to be absent . These findings indicate that the process of lineage commitment proceeds through an ordered but not random process . By extending the area of investigation to include the erythroid lineage , more convincing evidence for the ordered process was obtained . Detailed and exact illustration of the process of hematopoiesis will provide an opportunity to revive hematopoiesis as one of the most fascinating targets of research in developmental biology Epstein - Barr Virus and its glycoprotein - 350 upregulate IL - 6 in human B - lymphocytes via CD21 , involving activation of NF - kappaB and different signaling pathways . Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) is a ubiquitous and highly immunotropic gamma herpesvirus that infects more than 90 % of humans worldwide . Its pathogenicity leads to a number of diseases including tumors that result from EBV ' s ability to readily transform B - lymphocytes and , to a lesser extent , epithelial cells . EBV utilizes CD21 / CR2 as its receptor on B cells to initiate the infection process . EBV binds to CR2 through its major envelope glycoprotein - 350 ( gp350 ) and is also a remarkable immunomodulating agent . We had previously shown that EBV is capable of modulating the synthesis of a number of cytokines . We now show that while both purified recombinant gp350 ( rgp350 ) and EBV upregulate IL - 6 mRNA synthesis in B cells , EBV - induced IL - 6 gene activation occurs for a significantly longer period of time ( i . e . 12 hours for EBV as compared to 6 hours for rgp350 ) . Moreover , the half - life of EBV - induced IL - 6 mRNA was also significantly longer ( 10 hours ) than that of mRNA induced by rgp350 ( about 6 hours ) . Both EBV and gp350 enhance the binding of the NF - kappaB transcription factor , as determined by band - shift and augment NF - kappaB - mediated activation of a CAT reporter plasmid . Furthermore , we demonstrate that while the activation of IL - 6 gene expression by gp350 is mediated primarily by the protein kinase C pathway , EBV can mediate its effects through multiple signaling pathways . To our knowledge this is the first report showing that the binding of a herpesvirus envelope glycoprotein to CR2 on human B cells results in the activation of the NF - kappaB transcription factor leading to the upregulation of IL - 6 gene expression in these lymphocytes .

In a previous study , we found that treating transgenic Big Blue rats with the hepatocarcinogen N - hydroxy - 2 - acetylaminofluorene ( N - OH - AAF ) produced the same major DNA adduct in the target liver and the nontarget spleen lymphocytes and bone marrow cells , induced lacI mutants in the liver , and induced much lower frequencies of l acI and hprt mutants in spleen lymphocytes . In the present study , sequence analysis was conducted on lacI DNA and hprt cDNA from the mutants , to determine the mutational specificity of N - OH - AAF in the rat . All the mutation spectra from N - OH - AAF - treated rats differed significantly from corresponding mutation profiles from untreated animals ( P = 0 . 02 to P < 0 . 0001 ) . Although there were similarities among the mutational patterns derived from N - OH - AAF - treated rats ( e . g . , G : C - - > T : A transversion was the most common mutation in all mutation sets ) , there were significant differences in the patterns of basepair substitution and frameshift mutation between the liver and spleen lymphocyte lacI mutants ( P = 0 . 02 ) and between the spleen lymphocyte lacI and hprt mutants ( P = 0 . 04 ) . Also , multiplex PCR analysis of genomic DNA from the hprt mutants indicated that 12 % of mutants from treated rats had major deletions in the hprt gene ; no corresponding incidence of large deletions was evident among lacI mutations . All the mutation profiles reflect the general mutational specificity of the major DNA adduct formed by N - OH - AAF . The differences between N - OH - AAF mutation in the endogenous gene and transgene can be partially explained by the structures of the two genes . The tissue - specificity of the mutation spectra may contribute to targeting tumor formation to the liver . Environ . Mol . Mutagen . 37 : 203 - 214 , 2001 . Published 2001 Wiley - Liss , Inc . Caspase - dependent cleavage of the hematopoietic specific adaptor protein Gads alters signalling from the T cell receptor . Gads is a SH2 and SH3 domain - containing , hematopoietic - specific adaptor protein that functions in signalling from the T cell receptor . Gads acts by linking SLP - 76 , bound by the carboxy - terminal Gads SH3 domain , to tyrosine phosphorylated LAT which contains binding sites for the Gads SH2 domain . Gads is distinguished from Grb2 and the closely related Grap protein by the presence of a 120 amino acid unique region between the SH2 domain and the carboxy terminal SH3 domain . Here we demonstrate that the unique region of Gads contains a capase cleavage site . Induction of apoptosis in lymphocytes results in detectable Gads cleavage by 60 min . Gads cleavage is blocked in vivo by treating cells with a caspase 3 inhibitor . A putative caspase 3 cleavage site was identified within the unique region and mutation of this site prevented Gads cleavage in vitro , and in vivo . The Gads cleavage products retained the predicted binding specificity for SLP - 76 and LAT . Expression of the Gads cleavage products in Jurkat T cells inhibited NFAT activation following TCR cross linking . These findings indicate that cleavage of Gads in vivo could function to alter signalling downstream of the T cell receptor by disrupting cross talk between SLP - 76 and LAT . Targeting of p300 to the interleukin - 2 promoter via CREB - Rel cross - talk during mitogen and oncogenic molecular signaling in activated T - cells . In this report , we explore the mechanisms of targeting of p300 to the interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) promoter in response to mitogenic and oncogenic molecular signals . Recruitment of p300 by cAMP - responsive element - binding protein - Rel cross - talk at the composite CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) - TRE element of the IL - 2 promoter is essential for promoter inducibility during T - cell activation , and CD28RE - TRE is the exclusive target of the human T - cell lymphotropic virus type I oncoprotein Tax . The intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity of p300 is dispensable for activation of the IL - 2 promoter , and the N - terminal 743 residues contain the minimal structural requirements for synergistic transactivation of the CD28RE - TRE , the IL - 2 promoter , and endogenous IL - 2 gene expression . Mutational analysis of p300 reveals differential structural requirements for the N - terminal p300 module by individual cis - elements within the IL - 2 promoter . These findings provide evidence that p300 assembles at the IL - 2 promoter to form an enhanceosome - like signal transduction target that is centrally integrated at the CD28RE - TRE element of the IL - 2 promoter through specific protein module - targeted associations in activated T - cells . Regulation of cytokine production in T - cell responses to inhalant allergen : GATA - 3 expression distinguishes between Th1 - and Th2 - polarized immunity . BACKGROUND : The precise nature of allergen - specific cytokine responses in atopics versus non - atopics , in particular the ' Th1 polarity ' of responses in non - atopics , remains controversial . This is due in part to the relative insensitivity of cytokine detection systems , and associated variations in kinetics of cytokine production and catabolism in in vitro culture systems . As an alternative to cytokine measurement , this study focuses on expression of the transcription factor GATA - 3 for analysis of allergen - specific Th cell responses . METHODS : Cord blood mononuclear cells were Th1 - or Th2 - polarized by culture in IL - 12 - or IL - 4 - employing established methods ; PBMC from house dust mite ( HDM ) - sensitive atopics and controls were stimulated overnight with HDM ; cytokine production was measured by ELISA and GATA - 3 mRNA expression by PCR . RESULTS : Cytokine - driven Th2 polarization of naive T cells is associated with marked upregulation of GATA - 3 expression , whereas a reciprocal expression pattern accompanies differentiation towards the Th1 cytokine phenotype . In T cells from HDM skin prick test - positive ( HDM - SPT + / HDM - IgE + ) volunteers , overnight stimulation results in marked upregulation of GATA - 3 expression , compared to an equally marked downregulation of expression in T cells from SPT - / IgE - subjects . In subjects who are HDM - SPT + but IgE - , GATA - 3 expression levels remained relatively stable during culture with HDM . CONCLUSIONS : Upregulation of GATA - 3 expression in PBMC is a hallmark of the early phase of Th2 recall responses to specific allergen in atopics . The reciprocal expression pattern observed in HDM - specific recall responses of non - atopics provides independent confirmation of the presence of underlying Th1 - like immunity in these subjects . The parallel findings in neonatal T cells suggest that the same approach may be utilized for monitoring the progress of allergen - specific Th1 / Th2 memory development during early childhood , and hence in assessment of risk for future allergic disease . Copyright 2001 S . Karger AG , Basel The heat shock response reduces myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein - induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice . The stress response ( SR ) can block inflammatory gene expression by preventing activation of transcription factor nuclear factor - kappa B ( NF - kappaB ) . As inflammatory gene expression contributes to the pathogenesis of demyelinating diseases , we tested the effects of the SR on the progression of the demyelinating disease experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) . EAE was actively induced in C57BL / 6 mice using an encephalitogenic myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein ( MOG ( 35 - 55 ) ) peptide . Whole body hyperthermia was used to induce a heat shock response ( HSR ) in immunized mice 2 days after the booster MOG ( 35 - 55 ) peptide injection . The HSR reduced the incidence of EAE by 70 % , delayed disease onset by 6 days , and attenuated disease severity . The HSR attenuated leukocyte infiltration into CNS assessed by quantitation of perivascular infiltrates , and by reduced staining for CD4 and CD25 immunopositive T - cells . T - cell activation , assessed by the production of interferon gamma ( IFNgamma ) in response to MOG ( 35 - 55 ) , was also decreased by the HSR . The HSR reduced inflammatory gene expression in the brain that normally occurs during EAE , including the early increase in RANTES ( regulated on activation of normal T - cell expressed and secreted ) expression , and the later expression of the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase . The early activation of transcription factor NF - kappaB was also blocked by the HSR . The finding that the SR reduces inflammation in the brain and the clinical severity of EAE opens a novel therapeutic approach for prevention of autoimmune diseases . In vivo detection of intracellular signaling pathways in developing thymocytes . Information regarding the intracellular signaling processes that occur during the development of T cells has largely been obtained with the use of transgenic mouse models , which although providing invaluable information are time consuming and costly . To this end , we have developed a novel system that facilitates the in vivo analysis of signal transduction pathways during T - lymphocyte development . This approach uses reporter - plasmids for the detection of intracellular signals mediated by the mitogen - activated protein kinase or cyclic AMP - dependent protein kinase . Reporter - plasmids are transfected into thymocytes in fetal thymic organ culture by accelerated DNA / particle bombardment ( gene gun ) , and the activation of a signaling pathway is determined in the form of a standard luciferase assay . Importantly , this powerful technique preserves the structural integrity of the thymus , and will provide an invaluable tool to study how thymocytes respond to normal environmental stimuli encountered during differentiation within the thymic milieu . Thus , this method allows for the monitoring of signals that occur in a biological time frame , such as during differentiation , and within the natural environment of differentiating cells . Core - binding factor beta ( CBFbeta ) , but not CBFbeta - smooth muscle myosin heavy chain , rescues definitive hematopoiesis in CBFbeta - deficient embryonic stem cells . Core - binding factor beta ( CBFbeta ) is the non - DNA - binding subunit of the heterodimeric CBFs . Genes encoding CBFbeta ( CBFB ) , and one of the DNA - binding CBFalpha subunits , Runx1 ( also known as CBFalpha2 , AML1 , and PEBP2alphaB ) , are required for normal hematopoiesis and are also frequent targets of chromosomal translocations in acute leukemias in humans . Homozygous disruption of either the Runx1 or Cbfb gene in mice results in embryonic lethality at midgestation due to hemorrhaging in the central nervous system , and severely impairs fetal liver hematopoiesis . Results of this study show that Cbfb - deficient mouse embryonic stem ( ES ) cells can differentiate into primitive erythroid colonies in vitro , but are impaired in their ability to produce definitive erythroid and myeloid colonies , mimicking the in vivo defect . Definitive hematopoiesis is restored by ectopic expression of full - length Cbfb transgenes , as well as by a transgene encoding only the heterodimerization domain of CBFbeta . In contrast , the CBFbeta - smooth muscle myosin heavy chain ( SMMHC ) fusion protein generated by the inv ( 16 ) associated with acute myeloid leukemias ( M4Eo ) can not rescue definitive hematopoiesis by Cbfb - deficient ES cells . Sequences responsible for the inability of CBFbeta - SMMHC to rescue definitive hematopoiesis reside in the SMMHC portion of the fusion protein . Results also show that the CBFbeta - SMMHC fusion protein transdominantly inhibits definitive hematopoiesis , but not to the same extent as homozygous loss of Runx1 or Cbfb . CBFbeta - SMMHC preferentially inhibits the differentiation of myeloid lineage cells , while increasing the number of blastlike cells in culture . The latency pattern of Epstein - Barr virus infection and viral IL - 10 expression in cutaneous natural killer / T - cell lymphomas . The nasal type , extranodal natural killer or T ( NK / T ) - cell lymphoma is usually associated with latent Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) infection . In order to elucidate the EBV gene expression patterns in vivo , we examined eight patients with cutaneous EBV - related NK / T - cell lymphomas , including six patients with a NK - cell phenotype and two patients with a T - cell phenotype . The implication of EBV in the skin lesions was determined by the presence of EBV - DNA , EBV - encoded nuclear RNA ( EBER ) and a clonality of EBV - DNA fragments containing the terminal repeats . Transcripts of EBV - encoded genes were screened by reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) , and confirmed by Southern blot hybridization . The expression of EBV - related antigens was examined by immunostaining using paraffin - embedded tissue sections and cell pellets of EBV - positive cell lines . Our study demonstrated that all samples from the patients contained EBV nuclear antigen ( EBNA ) - 1 mRNA which was transcribed using the Q promoter , whereas both the Q promoter and another upstream promoter ( Cp / Wp ) were used in EBV - positive cell lines , B95 . 8 , Raji and Jiyoye . Latent membrane protein - 1 ( LMP - 1 ) mRNA was detected in seven of eight patients and all cell lines , whereas EBNA - 2 transcripts were found only in the cell lines . Immunostaining showed no LMP - 1 , EBNA - 2 or ZEBRA antigens in the paraffin - embedded tissue sections , although they were positive in the cell line cells . Latent BHRF1 transcripts encoding bcl - 2 homologue and BCRF1 transcripts encoding viral interleukin ( vIL ) - 10 were detected in one and two of eight patients , respectively . A patient with NK - cell lymphoma expressing both transcripts died of rapid progression of the illness . Our results indicate that the restricted expression of the latency - associated EBV genes and the production of vIL - 10 and bcl - 2 homologue may favour tumour growth , evading the host immune surveillance .

Synthetic high affinity peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor ( PPAR ) agonists are known , but biologic ligands are of low affinity . Oxidized low density lipoprotein ( oxLDL ) is inflammatory and signals through PPARs . We showed , by phospholipase A ( 1 ) digestion , that PPARgamma agonists in oxLDL arise from the small pool of alkyl phosphatidylcholines in LDL . We identified an abundant oxidatively fragmented alkyl phospholipid in oxLDL , hexadecyl azelaoyl phosphatidylcholine ( azPC ) , as a high affinity ligand and agonist for PPARgamma . [ ( 3 ) H ] azPC bound recombinant PPARgamma with an affinity ( K ( d ) ( ( app ) ) approximately 40 nm ) that was equivalent to rosiglitazone ( BRL49653 ) , and competition with rosiglitazone showed that binding occurred in the ligand - binding pocket . azPC induced PPRE reporter gene expression , as did rosiglitazone , with a half - maximal effect at 100 nm . Overexpression of PPARalpha or PPARgamma revealed that azPC was a specific PPARgamma agonist . The scavenger receptor CD36 is encoded by a PPRE - responsive gene , and azPC enhanced expression of CD36 in primary human monocytes . We found that anti - CD36 inhibited azPC uptake , and it inhibited PPRE reporter induction . Results with a small molecule phospholipid flippase mimetic suggest azPC acts intracellularly and that cellular azPC accumulation was efficient . Thus , certain alkyl phospholipid oxidation products in oxLDL are specific , high affinity extracellular ligands and agonists for PPARgamma that induce PPAR - responsive genes Regulation of the human MAT2B gene encoding the regulatory beta subunit of methionine adenosyltransferase , MAT II . Methionine adenosyltransferase ( MAT ) catalyzes the biosynthesis of S - adenosylmethionine ( AdoMet ) , a key molecule in transmethylation reactions and polyamine biosynthesis . The MAT II isozyme consists of a catalytic alpha2 and a regulatory beta subunit . Down - regulation of the MAT II beta subunit expression causes a 6 - 10 - fold increase in intracellular AdoMet levels . To understand the mechanism by which the beta subunit expression is regulated , we cloned the MAT2B gene , determined its organization , characterized its 5 ' - flanking sequences , and elucidated the in vitro and in vivo regulation of its promoter . Transcription of the MAT2B gene initiates at position - 203 relative to the translation start site . Promoter deletion analysis defined a minimal promoter between positions + 52 and + 93 base pairs , a GC - rich region . Inclusion of the sequences between - 4 and + 52 enhanced promoter activity ; this was primarily because of an Sp1 recognition site at + 9 / + 15 . The inclusion of sequences up to position - 115 provided full activity ; this was attributed to a TATA at - 32 . The Sp1 site at position + 9 was key for the formation of protein . DNA complexes . Mutation of both the Sp1 site at + 9 and the TATA at - 32 reduced promoter activity to its minimal level . Supershift assays showed no effect of the anti - Sp1 antibody on complex formation , whereas the anti - Sp3 antibody had a strong effect on protein . DNA complex formation , suggesting that Sp3 is one of the main factors binding to this Sp1 site . Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays supported the involvement of both Sp1 and Sp3 in complexes formed on the MAT2B promoter . The data show that the 5 ' - untranslated sequences play an important role in regulating the MAT2B gene and identifies the Sp1 site at + 9 as a potential target for modulating MAT2B expression , a process that can have a major effect on intracellular AdoMet levels . Molecular pathogenesis of influenza A virus infection and virus - induced regulation of cytokine gene expression . Despite vaccines and antiviral substances influenza still causes significant morbidity and mortality world wide . Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of influenza virus replication , pathogenesis and host immune responses is required for the development of more efficient means of prevention and treatment of influenza . Influenza A virus , which replicates in epithelial cells and leukocytes , regulates host cell transcriptional and translational systems and activates , as well as downregulates apoptotic pathways . Influenza A virus infection results in the production of chemotactic ( RANTES , MIP - 1 alpha , MCP - 1 , MCP - 3 , and IP - 10 ) , pro - inflammatory ( IL - 1 beta , IL - 6 , IL - 18 , and TNF - alpha ) , and antiviral ( IFN - alpha / beta ) cytokines . Cytokine gene expression is associated with the activation of NF - kappa B , AP - 1 , STAT and IRF signal transducing molecules in influenza A virus - infected cells . In addition of upregulating cytokine gene expression , influenza A virus infection activates caspase - 1 enzyme , which is involved in the proteolytic processing of proIL - 1 beta and proIL - 18 into their biologically active forms . Influenza A virus - induced IFN - alpha / beta is essential in host ' s antiviral defence by activating the expression of antiviral Mx , PKR and oligoadenylate synthetase genes . IFN - alpha / beta also prolongs T cell survival , upregulates IL - 12 and IL - 18 receptor gene expression and together with IL - 18 stimulates NK and T cell IFN - gamma production and the development of Th1 - type immune response . Comparison of hprt and lacI mutant frequency with DNA adduct formation in N - hydroxy - 2 - acetylaminofluorene - treated Big Blue rats . N - Hydroxy - 2 - acetylaminofluorene ( N - OH - AAF ) is the proximate carcinogenic metabolite of the powerful rat liver carcinogen 2 - acetylaminofluorene . In this study , transgenic Big Blue ( R ) rats were used to examine the relationship between in vivo mutagenicity and DNA adduct formation by N - OH - AAF in the target liver compared with that in nontarget tissues . Male rats were given one , two , or four doses of 25 mg N - OH - AAF / kg body weight by i . p . injection at 4 - day intervals , and groups of treated and control rats were euthanized up to 10 weeks after beginning the dosing . Mutant frequencies were measured in the spleen lymphocyte hprt gene , and lacI mutant frequencies were determined in the liver and spleen lymphocytes . At 6 weeks after beginning the dosing , the hprt mutant frequency in spleen lymphocytes from the four - dose group was 16 . 5 x 10 ( - 6 ) compared with 3 . 2 x 10 ( - 6 ) in control animals . Also at 6 weeks , rats given one , two , or four doses of N - OH - AAF had lacI mutant frequencies in the liver of 97 . 6 , 155 . 6 , and 406 . 8 x 10 ( - 6 ) , respectively , compared with a control frequency of 25 . 7 x 10 ( - 6 ) ; rats given four doses had lacI mutant frequencies in spleen lymphocytes of 55 . 8 x 10 ( - 6 ) compared with a control frequency of 20 . 4 x 10 ( - 6 ) . Additional rats were evaluated for DNA adduct formation in the liver , spleen lymphocytes , and bone marrow by ( 32 ) P - postlabeling . Adduct analysis was conducted 1 day after one , two , and four treatments with N - OH - AAF , 5 days after one treatment , and 9 days after two treatments . N - ( Deoxyguanosin - 8 - yl ) - 2 - aminofluorene was the major DNA adduct identified in all the tissues examined . Adduct concentrations increased with total dose to maximum values in samples taken 1 day after two doses , and remained essentially the same after four doses . In samples taken after four doses , adduct levels were 103 , 28 , and 7 fmol / microg of DNA in liver , spleen lymphocytes , and bone marrow , respectively . The results indicate that the extent of both DNA adduct formation and mutant induction correlates with the organ specificity for N - OH - AAF carcinogenesis in the rat . Environ . Mol . Mutagen . 37 : 195 - 202 , 2001 . Published 2001 Wiley - Liss , Inc . Expression of Mad1 in T cells leads to reduced thymic cellularity and impaired mitogen - induced proliferation . To investigate Mad1 function in vivo , transgenic mice were generated that express a Mad1 transgene in T lineage cells under the control of the proximal lck promoter . Thymus size in lck - Mad1 transgenic mice is drastically reduced although representation of the various thymocyte sub populations appears normal . To investigate more closely any effects of Mad1 expression on thymocytes , we examined thymic selection using MHC class I - restricted H - Y - TCR transgenic mice . Mad1 expression in vivo reduces the efficiency of positive selection . Furthermore , thymocytes and splenic T cells from lck - Mad1 transgenic mice display a profound proliferative defect in response to activation with either PMA / Ionomycin or immobilized anti - CD3 / CD28 antibody . This proliferative defect is not reversed by addition of exogenous IL - 2 and is p53 - independent . The growth inhibition caused by Mad1 is overcome by expression of active c - Myc . Differential requirement for the transcription factor PU . 1 in the generation of natural killer cells versus B and T cells . PU . 1 is a member of the Ets family of transcription factors required for the development of various lymphoid and myeloid cell lineages , but its role in natural killer ( NK ) cell development is not known . The study shows that PU . 1 is expressed in NK cells and that , on cell transfer into alymphoid Rag2 / gammac ( - / - ) mice , hematopoietic progenitors of PU . 1 ( - / - ) fetal liver cells could generate functional NK cells but not B or T cells . Nevertheless , the numbers of bone marrow NK cell precursors and splenic mature NK cells were reduced compared to controls . Moreover , PU . 1 ( - / - ) NK cells displayed reduced expression of the receptors for stem cell factor and interleukin ( IL ) - 7 , suggesting a nonredundant role for PU . 1 in regulating the expression of these cytokine receptor genes during NK cell development . PU . 1 ( - / - ) NK cells also showed defective expression of inhibitory and activating members of the Ly49 family and failed to proliferate in response to IL - 2 and IL - 12 . Thus , despite the less stringent requirement for PU . 1 in NK cell development compared to B and T cells , PU . 1 regulates NK cell differentiation and homeostasis . Benzene - extracted components are important for the major activity of diesel exhaust particles : effect on interleukin - 8 gene expression in human bronchial epithelial cells . Epidemiologic and experimental studies suggest that diesel exhaust particles ( DEPs ) may be related to increasing respiratory mortality and morbidity . We have shown that DEPs augmented the production of inflammatory cytokines by human airway epithelial cells in vitro . To better understand the mechanisms of their proinflammatory activities , we studied the effects of several components extracted from DEPs on interleukin ( IL ) - 8 expression in human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS - 2B and normal human airway epithelial cells obtained from very peripheral airways by an ultrathin bronchoscope . We used several agents active on signal transduction pathways in cytokine expression , such as the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporin , antioxidant agents including N - acetyl cysteine ( NAC ) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) , and p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) inhibitor SB203580 . Benzene - extracted components showed effects mimicking DEPs on IL - 8 gene expression , release of several cytokines ( IL - 8 ; granulocyte macrophage colony - stimulating factor ; and regulated on activation , normal T cells expressed and secreted ) and nuclear factor ( NF ) - kappa B activation . We also found that NAC , PDTC , and SB203580 suppressed the activities of DEPs and their benzene extracts , suggesting the roles of oxidants - mediated NF - kappa B activation and p38MAPK pathways . Finally , benzo [ a ] pyrene , one of the important compounds included in the benzene component , replicated the activities shown by DEPs . The nuclear receptor PPAR gamma is expressed by mouse T lymphocytes and PPAR gamma agonists induce apoptosis . Peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor ( PPAR ) - gamma is a nuclear hormone receptor that serves as a trans factor to regulate lipid metabolism . Intense interest is focused on PPAR - gamma and its ligands owing to its putative role in adipocyte differentiation . Little is known , however , about the functions of PPAR - gamma in the immune system , especially in T lymphocytes . We demonstrate that both naive and activated ovalbumin - specific T cells from DO11 . 10 - transgenic mice express PPAR - gamma mRNA and protein . In order to determine the function of PPAR - gamma , T cells were stimulated with phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate and ionomycin or antigen and antigen - presenting cells . Simultaneous exposure to PPAR - gamma ligands ( e . g . 15 - deoxy - Delta ( 12 , 14 ) - prostaglandin J ( 2 ) , troglitazone ) showed drastic inhibition of proliferation and significant decreases in cell viability . The decrease in cell viability was due to apoptosis of the T lymphocytes , and occurred only when cells were treated with PPAR - gamma , and not PPAR - alpha agonists , revealing specificity of this response for PPAR - gamma . These observations suggest that PPAR - gamma agonists play an important role in regulating T cell - mediated immune responses by inducing apoptosis . T cell death via PPAR - gamma ligation may act as a potent anti - inflammatory signal in the immune system , and ligands could possibly be used to control disorders in which excessive inflammation occurs . Suppression of lung inflammation in rats by prevention of NF - kappaB activation in the liver . Activation of NF - kappaB and production of NF - kappaB - dependent chemokines are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of neutrophilic lung inflammation . Calpain - 1 inhibitor ( CI - 1 ) blocks activation of NF - kappaB by preventing proteolysis of the inhibitory protein IkappaB - alpha by the ubiquitin / proteasome pathway . We hypothesized that inhibition of proteasome function with CI - 1 would block NF - kappaB activation in vivo after intraperitoneal ( i . p . ) treatment with bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , and that NF - kappaB inhibition would be associated with suppression of chemokine gene expression and attenuation of neutrophilic alveolitis . We treated rats with a single i . p . injection of CI - 1 ( 10 mg / kg ) two hours prior to i . p . LPS ( 7 mg / kg ) . Treatment with Cl - 1 prevented degradation of IkappaB - alpha and activation of NF - kappaB in the liver in response to LPS ; however , Cl - 1 treatment had no detected effect on NF - kappaB activation in lung tissue . CI - 1 treatment prior to LPS resulted in 40 % lower MIP - 2 concentration in lung lavage fluid compared to rats treated with vehicle prior to LPS ( 502 + / - 112 pg / ml vs . 859 + / - 144 pg / ml , P < 0 . 05 ) . In addition , CI - 1 treatment substantially inhibited LPS - induced neutrophilic alveolitis ( 2 . 7 + / - 1 . 2 x 10 ( 5 ) vs . 43 . 7 + / - 12 . 2 x 10 ( 5 ) lung lavage neutrophils , P < 0 . 01 ) . These data indicate that NF - kappaB inhibition in the liver can alter lung inflammation induced by systemic LPS treatment and suggest that a liver - lung interaction contributes to the inflammatory response of the lung . Notch1 regulates maturation of CD4 + and CD8 + thymocytes by modulating TCR signal strength . Notch signaling regulates cell fate decisions in multiple lineages . We demonstrate in this report that retroviral expression of activated Notch1 in mouse thymocytes abrogates differentiation of immature CD4 + CD8 + thymocytes into both CD4 and CD8 mature single - positive T cells . The ability of Notch1 to inhibit T cell development was observed in vitro and in vivo with both normal and TCR transgenic thymocytes . Notch1 - mediated developmental arrest was dose dependent and was associated with impaired thymocyte responses to TCR stimulation . Notch1 also inhibited TCR - mediated signaling in Jurkat T cells . These data indicate that constitutively active Notch1 abrogates CD4 + and CD8 + maturation by interfering with TCR signal strength and provide an explanation for the physiological regulation of Notch expression during thymocyte development . Expression of SART3 antigen and induction of CTLs by SART3 - derived peptides in breast cancer patients . We recently reported the SART3 tumour - rejection antigen as possessing tumour epitopes capable of inducing HLA - class I - restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) . This study investigated expression of the SART3 antigen in breast cancer to explore an appropriate molecule for use in specific immunotherapy of breast cancer patients . The SART3 antigen was detected in all of the breast cancer cell lines tested , 30 of 40 ( 75 % ) breast cancer tissue samples , and 0 of 3 non - tumourous breast tissue samples . SART3 derived peptides at positions 109 - 118 and 315 - 323 induced HLA - A24 restricted CTLs that reacted to breast cancer cells from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) of breast cancer patients . Therefore , the SART3 antigen and its peptides could be an appropriate molecule for use in specific immunotherapy of the majority of HLA - A24 - positive breast cancer patients Autostimulation of the Epstein - Barr virus BRLF1 promoter is mediated through consensus Sp1 and Sp3 binding sites . As an essential step in the lytic cascade , the Rta homologues of gammaherpesviruses all activate their own expression . Consistent with this biologic function , the Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) Rta protein powerfully stimulates the promoter of its own gene , Rp , in EBV - positive B cells in transient - transfection reporter - based assays . We analyzed the activity of RpCAT in response to Rta by deletional and site - directed mutagenesis . Two cognate Sp1 binding sites located at - 279 and - 45 relative to the transcriptional start site proved crucial for Rta - mediated activation . Previously described binding sites for the cellular transcription factor Zif268 and the viral transactivator ZEBRA were found to be dispensable for activation of RpCAT by Rta . Gel shift analysis , using extracts of B cells in latency or induced into the lytic cycle , identified Sp1 and Sp3 as the predominant cellular proteins bound to Rp near - 45 . During the lytic cycle , ZEBRA bound Rp near the Sp1 / Sp3 site . The binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to Rp correlated with the reporter activities in the mutagenesis study , establishing a direct link between transcriptional activation of Rp by Rta and DNA binding by Sp1 and / or Sp3 . The relative abundance or functional state of the cellular Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors may be altered in response to stimuli that induce the BRLF1 promoter and thereby contribute to the activation of the viral lytic cycle . Gene transfer of antisense hypoxia inducible factor - 1 alpha enhances the therapeutic efficacy of cancer immunotherapy . Solid tumors meet their demands for nascent blood vessels and increased glycolysis , to combat hypoxia , by activating multiple genes involved in angiogenesis and glucose metabolism . Hypoxia inducible factor - 1 ( HIF - 1 ) is a constitutively expressed basic helix - loop - helix transcription factor , formed by the assembly of HIF - 1alpha and HIF - 1beta ( Arnt ) , that is stablized in response to hypoxia , and rapidly degraded under normoxic conditions . It activates the transcription of genes important for maintaining oxygen homeostasis . Here , we demonstrate that engineered down - regulation of HIF - 1alpha by intratumoral gene transfer of an antisense HIF - 1alpha plasmid leads to the down - regulation of VEGF , and decreased tumor microvessel density . Antisense HIF - 1alpha monotherapy resulted in the complete and permanent rejection of small ( 0 . 1 cm in diameter ) EL - 4 tumors , which is unusual for an anti - angiogenic agent where transient suppression of tumor growth is the norm . It induced NK cell - dependent rejection of tumors , but failed to stimulate systemic T cell - mediated anti - tumor immunity , and synergized with B7 - 1 - mediated immunotherapy to cause the NK cell and CD8 T cell - dependent rejection of larger EL - 4 tumors ( 0 . 4 cm in diameter ) that were refractory to monotherapies . Mice cured of their tumors by combination therapy resisted a rechallenge with parental tumor cells , indicating systemic antitumor immunity had been achieved . In summary , whilst intensive investigations are in progress to target the many HIF - 1 effectors , the results herein indicate that blocking hypoxia - inducible pathways and enhancing NK - mediated antitumor immunity by targeting HIF - 1 itself may be advantageous , especially when combined with cancer immunotherapy . Runx2 : a novel oncogenic effector revealed by in vivo complementation and retroviral tagging . The Runx2 ( Cbfa1 , Pebp2alphaA , Aml3 ) gene was previously identified as a frequent target for transcriptional activation by proviral insertion in T - cell lymphomas of CD2 - MYC transgenic mice . We have recently shown that over - expression of the full - length , most highly expressed Runx2 isoform in the thymus perturbs T - cell development , leads to development of spontaneous lymphomas at low frequency and is strongly synergistic with Myc . To gain further insight into the relationship of Runx2 to other lymphomagenic pathways , we tested the effect of combining the CD2 - Runx2 transgene either with a Pim1 transgene ( E ( mu ) - Pim1 ) or with the p53 null genotype , as each of these displays independent synergy with Myc . In both cases we observed synergistic tumour development . However , Runx2 appeared to have a dominant effect on the tumour phenotype in each case , with most tumours conforming to the CD3 ( + ) , CD8 ( + ) , CD4 ( + / - ) phenotype seen in CD2 - Runx2 mice . Neonatal infection of CD2 - Runx2 mice with Moloney murine leukaemia virus ( Moloney MLV ) also led to a dramatic acceleration of tumour onset . Analysis of known Moloney MLV target genes in these lymphomas showed a high frequency of rearrangement at c - Myc or N - Myc ( 82 % ) , and a significant number at Pim1 or Pim2 ( 23 % ) , and at Pal1 / Gfi1 ( 18 % ) . These results indicate that Runx2 makes a distinct contribution to T - cell lymphoma development which does not coincide with any of the oncogene complementation groups previously identified by retroviral tagging . The involvement of TNF - alpha - related apoptosis - inducing ligand in the enhanced cytotoxicity of IFN - beta - stimulated human dendritic cells to tumor cells . TNF - alpha - related apoptosis - inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) is characterized by its preferential induction of apoptosis of tumor cells but not normal cells . Dendritic cells ( DCs ) , besides their role as APCs , now have been demonstrated to exert cytotoxicity or cytostasis on some tumor cells . Here , we report that both human CD34 ( + ) stem cell - derived DCs ( CD34DCs ) and human CD14 ( + ) monocyte - derived DCs ( MoDCs ) express TRAIL and exhibit cytotoxicity to some types of tumor cells partially through TRAIL . Moderate expression of TRAIL appeared on CD34DCs from the 8th day of culture and was also seen on freshly isolated monocytes . The level of TRAIL expression remained constant until DC maturation . TRAIL expression on immature CD34DCs or MoDCs was greatly up - regulated after IFN - beta stimulation . Moreover , IFN - beta could strikingly enhance the ability of CD34DCs or MoDCs to kill TRAIL - sensitive tumor cells , but LPS did not have such an effect . The up - regulation of TRAIL on IFN - beta - stimulated DCs partially contributed to the increased cytotoxicity of DCS : Pretreatment of TRAIL - sensitive tumor cells with caspase - 3 inhibitor could significantly increase their resistance to the cytotoxicity of IFN - beta - stimulated DCS : In contrast , NF - kappaB inhibitor could significantly increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to the killing by nonstimulated or LPS - stimulated DCS : Our studies demonstrate that IFN - beta - stimulated DCs are functionally cytotoxic . Thus , an innate mechanism of DC - mediated antitumor immunity might exist in vivo in which DCs act as effectors to directly kill tumor cells partially via TRAIL . Subsequently , DCs act as APCs involved in the uptake , processing , and presentation of apoptotic tumor Ags to cross - prime CD8 ( + ) CTL cells . Tumor cells regulate the lytic activity of tumor - specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes by modulating the inhibitory natural killer receptor function . Tumor - infiltrating p58 + T cells from a renal tumor were specifically expanded in response to tumor cell stimulation and cloned . These p58 + T cells were found to express a memory phenotype and corresponded to clonal TCRBV3 T - cell expansion . Functionally , p58 ( + ) CTLs displayed a low lytic activity for HLA - A2 tumor and normal cells . However , this lytic activity was significantly increased after blockade of p58 with specific monoclonal antibodies . Interestingly , we demonstrated that stimulation by tumor cells was required to trigger the inhibitory effect of p58 on the lytic activity of antigen - specific CTLs and that stimulation of the inhibitory function of p58 by tumor cells correlated with an inhibition of nuclear factor - kappaB activation in p58 + tumor - specific CTLS . T - cell factor - 1 expression during human natural killer cell development and in circulating CD56 ( + ) bright natural killer cells . Transcription factors are essential to govern differentiation along the lymphoid lineage from uncommitted hematopoietic stem cells . Although many of these transcription factors have putative roles based on murine knockout experiments , their function in human lymphoid development is less known and was studied further . Transcription factor expression in fresh and cultured adult human bone marrow and umbilical cord blood progenitors was evaluated . We found that fresh CD34 ( + ) Lin ( - ) cells that are human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) - DR ( - ) or CD38 ( - ) constitutively express GATA - 3 but not T - cell factor - 1 ( TCF - 1 ) or Id - 3 . Culture with the murine fetal liver cell line AFT024 and defined cytokines was capable of inducing TCF - 1 mRNA . However , no T - cell receptor gene rearrangement was identified in cultured progeny . Id - 3 , a basic helix loop helix factor with dominant negative function for T - cell differentiation transcription factors , also was upregulated and may explain unsuccessful T - cell maturation . To better understand the developmental link between natural killer ( NK ) cells derived from progenitors , we studied NK cell subsets circulating in blood . CD56 ( + bright ) , but not CD56 ( + dim ) , NK cells constitutively express TCF - 1 by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis . The TCF - 1 isoform found in CD56 ( + bright ) cells , which express lectin but not immunoglobulin class I recognizing inhibitory receptors , was identical to that induced in NK cell differentiation culture and was distinctly different from isoforms in T cells . These results suggest that TCF - 1 does not target human killer immunoglobulin receptor genes , TCF - 1 is uniquely expressed in circulating CD56 ( + bright ) NK cells , and specific TCF - 1 isoforms may play an important role in regulating NK differentiation from a common NK / T - cell progenitor . Transcriptional activation by a matrix associating region - binding protein . contextual requirements for the function of bright . Bright ( B cell regulator of IgH transcription ) is a B cell - specific , matrix associating region - binding protein that transactivates gene expression from the IgH intronic enhancer ( E mu ) . We show here that Bright has multiple contextual requirements to function as a transcriptional activator . Bright can not transactivate via out of context , concatenated binding sites . Transactivation is maximal on integrated substrates . Two of the three previously identified binding sites in E mu are required for full Bright transactivation . The Bright DNA binding domain defined a new family , which includes SWI1 , a component of the SWI . SNF complex shown to have high mobility group - like DNA binding characteristics . Similar to one group of high mobility group box proteins , Bright distorts E mu binding site - containing DNA on binding , supporting the concept that it mediates E mu remodeling . Transfection studies further implicate Bright in facilitating spatially separated promoter - enhancer interactions in both transient and stable assays . Finally , we show that overexpression of Bright leads to enhanced DNase I sensitivity of the endogenous E mu matrix associating regions . These data further suggest that Bright may contribute to increased gene expression by remodeling the immunoglobulin locus during B cell development . Analysis of BCL - 6 mutations in classic Hodgkin disease of the B - and T - cell type . BCL - 6 is essential for germinal center formation and thus for affinity maturation of immunoglobulin ( Ig ) genes by somatic mutations . The 5 ' - noncoding region of the BCL - 6 gene is even a target for the mutation machinery . Translocations of the BCL - 6 gene to heterologous promoters and mutations of its 5 ' - noncoding regulatory region were reported to be potential mechanisms for deregulating BCL - 6 expression and for playing a role in the genesis of non - Hodgkin lymphoma . In line with this hypothesis is the observation that B - cell lymphoma with somatic mutations , such as diffuse large B - cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma , also carry BCL - 6 mutations , some of which are recurrently detectable . Classic Hodgkin disease ( cHD ) is also derived from B cells with high loads of somatic mutations and thus a further candidate for BCL - 6 mutations . To determine the presence and potential role of BCL - 6 mutations in cHD , the 5 ' - noncoding BCL - 6 proportion of single Hodgkin and Reed - Sternberg ( HRS ) cells from 6 cases of cHD and 6 cases of HD - derived cell lines was analyzed . All B - cell - derived HD cases and cell lines harbored BCL - 6 mutations . In contrast , both T - cell - derived HD cases and cell lines were devoid of BCL - 6 mutations . With only one exception , there were no lymphoma - specific recurrent BCL - 6 mutations detected , and BCL - 6 protein was absent from the HRS cells of most cases . In conclusion , ( 1 ) somatic BCL - 6 mutations are restricted to cHD cases of B - cell origin , and ( 2 ) the BCL - 6 mutations represent mostly irrelevant somatic base substitutions without consequences for BCL - 6 protein expression and the pathogenesis of cHD . Gadd45gamma is dispensable for normal mouse development and T - cell proliferation . Gadd45gamma , a family member of the growth arrest and DNA damage - inducible gene family 45 ( Gadd45 ) , is strongly induced by interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) in peripheral T cells . While in most tissues all Gadd45 family members are expressed , Gadd45gamma is the only member that is induced by IL - 2 . Here we show that the IL - 2 - induced expression of Gadd45gamma is dependent on a signaling pathway mediated by the tyrosine kinase Jak3 and the transcription factors Stat5a and Stat5b ( signal transducer and activator of transcription ) . Previous studies with ectopically overexpressed Gadd45gamma in various cell lines implicated its function in negative growth control . To analyze the physiological role of Gadd45gamma we used homologous recombination to generate mice lacking Gadd45gamma . Gadd45gamma - deficient mice develop normally , are indistinguishable from their littermates , and are fertile . Furthermore , hematopoiesis in mice lacking Gadd45gamma is not impaired and Gadd45gamma - deficient T lymphocytes show normal responses to IL - 2 . These data demonstrate that Gadd45gamma is not essential for normal mouse development and hematopoiesis , possibly due to functional redundancy among the Gadd45 family members . Gadd45gamma is also dispensable for IL - 2 - induced T - cell proliferation . Decreased expression of c - myc family genes in thymuses from myasthenia gravis patients . The thymus is a critical organ for the elimination of autoreactive T cells by apoptosis . We studied the expression of apoptosis - associated genes , bcl - xL , bad , caspase - 3 , and c - myc family genes in myasthenia gravis ( MG ) thymuses . We observed that the mRNA levels of myc family genes , c - myc and max , were markedly reduced in MG thymuses . These results indicate that c - myc - mediated signaling is abnormal in MG thymuses . The levels of molecules whose expressions are associated with myc , such as STAM , prothymosin - alpha , and NFkappaB Immunohistochemical detection of interferon - gamma - producing cells in dermatophytosis . Skin lesions of dermatophytosis are thought to be a result of a T cell - dependent inflammatory response that is mediated by various cytokines . We examined whether IFN - gamma - positive cells ( as expression of Th1 response ) were present in the skin lesions of dermatophytosis in situ by immunohistochemical techniques . Mixtures of CD4 - positive T cells and CD8 - positive T cells were found to be present in the dermal infiltrates of the lesions . Considerable numbers of CD1a - positive cells were detected in the upper dermis and epidermis . A marked accumulation of CD68 - positive cells was found in the upper dermis . IFN - gamma - positive cells were present in the upper dermis of the lesions . The pattern of IFN - gamma staining appeared to be intracellular in mononuclear lymphoid cells . The staining was considered to be highly specific because it could be completely blocked by preabsorption with recombinant IFN - gamma . Our data support the hypothesis that the skin lesions of dermatophytosis may be associated with a Th1 response . Th1 response , which is characterized by IFN - gamma release , is thought to be involved in the host defense against dermatophytes and to reflect cutaneous reaction in dermatophytosis . Regulation of the helix - loop - helix proteins , E2A and Id3 , by the Ras - ERK MAPK cascade . Activation of mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathways leads to cellular differentiation and / or proliferation in a wide variety of cell types , including developing thymocytes . The basic helix - loop - helix ( bHLH ) proteins E12 and E47 and an inhibitor HLH protein , Id3 , play key roles in thymocyte differentiation . We show here that E2A DNA binding is lowered in primary immature thymocytes consequent to T cell receptor ( TCR ) - mediated ligation . Whereas expression of E2A mRNA and protein are unaltered , Id3 transcripts are rapidly induced upon signaling from the TCR . Activation of Id3 transcription is regulated in a dose - dependent manner by the extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) MAPK module . These observations directly connect the ERK MAPK cascade and HLH proteins in a linear pathway . Retinoic acid up - regulates myeloid ICAM - 3 expression and function in a cell - specific fashion - - evidence for retinoid signaling pathways in the mast cell lineage . Investigation of mast cell responsiveness toward retinoic acid ( RA ) revealed selective promotion of ICAM - 3 expression in the human mast cell line HMC - 1 . This process was dose - and time - dependent and detectable by flow cytometry , Western blot analysis , ELISA , and Northern blot analysis . ICAM - 3 modulation was found to be cell - type dependent , detectable also for HL - 60 cells and monocytes but not U - 937 and only weakly for KU812 cells . Terminally differentiated skin mast cells also failed to up - modulate their ICAM - 3 , suggesting the requirement for some degree of immaturity for the process . RA - mediated effects on ICAM - 1 expression , studied in parallel , were clearly distinct from those on ICAM - 3 . Investigation of retinoid receptor expression , known to mediate intracellular RA signaling , revealed presence of RAR alpha , RAR gamma , RXR beta , and RXR gamma transcripts in all cell lines studied , and HMC - 1 cells were the only line lacking RXR alpha . RAR beta , not expressed at baseline , was induced by RA in a fashion obviously correlating with ICAM - 3 up - regulation . Increased ICAM - 3 expression was of functional significance , such that processes stimulated or co - stimulated via ICAM - 3 ( homotypic aggregation , IL - 8 secretion ) were clearly enhanced upon RA pretreatment , suggesting that RA may contribute via hitherto unrecognized pathways to immune function and host defense . CD28 and T cell co - stimulation . Over the last decade the concept of T cell co - stimulation has emerged to take a central role in the process of T cell activation . However , the exact definition of co - stimulation is still unclear . In this review , we re - examine the concept of co - stimulation . We suggest that while co - stimulation is important , there is little evidence to link co - stimulation with T cell anergy . We then suggest a framework for studying co - stimulation . Focusing on recent advances in our understanding of CD28 , we discuss four areas of T cell activation where co - stimulation may play a role . Regulation of activator protein - 1 and NF - kappa B in CD8 + T cells exposed to peripheral self - antigens . The transcriptional events that control T cell tolerance to peripheral self Ags are still unknown . In this study , we analyzed the regulation of AP - 1 - and NF - kappa B - mediated transcription during in vivo induction of tolerance to a self Ag expressed exclusively on hepatocytes . Naive CD8 ( + ) Desire ( Des ) ( + ) T cells isolated from the Des TCR - transgenic mice that are specific for the H - 2K ( b ) class I Ag were transferred into Alb - K ( b ) - transgenic mice that express the H - 2K ( b ) Ag on hepatocytes only . Tolerance develops in these mice . We found that the self - reactive CD8 ( + ) Des ( + ) T cells were transiently activated , then became unresponsive and were further deleted . In contrast to CD8 ( + ) Des ( + ) T cells activated in vivo with APCs , which express high AP - 1 and high NF - kappa B transcriptional activity , the unresponsive CD8 ( + ) Des ( + ) T cells expressed no AP - 1 and only weak NF - kappa B transcriptional activity . The differences in NF - kappa B transcriptional activity correlated with the generation of distinct NF - kappa B complexes . Indeed , in vivo primed T cells predominantly express p50 / p50 and p65 / p50 dimers , whereas these p50 - containing complexes are barely detectable in tolerant T cells that express p65 - and c - Rel - containing complexes . These observations suggest that fine regulation of NF - kappa B complex formation may determine T cell fate . Transcriptional regulation in lymphocytes . Lymphocytes have been used to investigate many cellular processes , including lineage commitment , differentiation , proliferation and apoptosis . The transcription factors that mediate these processes are often expressed broadly in many cell types . The emerging theme is one of cell - type - specific regulation , affecting not only the functional activation of transcription factors but also their access to appropriate regions of DNA . Existence of retinoic acid - receptor - independent retinoid X - receptor - dependent pathway in myeloid cell function . We previously reported that ER - 27191 ( 4 - [ 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 - hexahydro - 7 , 7 , 10 , 10 - tetramethyl - 1 - ( 3 - pyridylmethyl ) anthra [ 1 , 2 - b ] pyrrol - 3 - yl ] benzoic acid ) is a potent antagonist of retinoic acid receptor ( RAR ) , and ER - 35795 ( ( 2E , 4E , 6E ) - 7 - [ 1 - ( 1 - methylethyl ) - 8 - chloro - 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 - tetrahydroquinolin - 6 - yl ] - 6 - fluoro - 3 - methyl - 2 , 4 , 6 - nonatrienoic acid ) is a novel retinoid X receptor ( RXR ) - specific agonist . By using these compounds , we investigated whether distinct RAR - dependent and RXR - dependent pathways operate to mediate the diverse activities of retinoids , particularly , the effects of the RXR pathway on cellular function . ER - 27191 completely antagonized HL60 cell differentiation induced by all - trans - retinoic acid ( atRA ) . However , the differentiation induced by the ER - 35795 was not antagonized at all by the RAR antagonist , but was inhibited by an RXR homodimer antagonist ( LGD100754 , ( 2E , 4E , 6Z ) - 7 - ( 3 - n - propoxy - 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 - tetrahydro - 5 , 5 , 8 , 8 - tetramethylnaphthale - 2 - yl ) - 3 - methylocta - 2 , 4 , 6 - trienoic acid ) . Its agonistic action on RXR / RAR heterodimer , on the other hand , was neutralized by the RAR antagonist . During HL60 cell differentiation , atRA induced RARbeta mRNA , while the RXR had no effect . Interestingly , a functional RXR - pathway was also seen in lipopolysaccharide - induced inhibition of mouse splenocyte proliferation . These results strongly suggest the existence of a pharmacological RXR - dependent pathway that is activated by a ligand that can bind to RXR . Targeting Src homology 2 domain - containing tyrosine phosphatase ( SHP - 1 ) into lipid rafts inhibits CD3 - induced T cell activation . To study the mechanism by which protein tyrosine phosphatases ( PTPs ) regulate CD3 - induced tyrosine phosphorylation , we investigated the distribution of PTPs in subdomains of plasma membrane . We report here that the bulk PTP activity associated with T cell membrane is present outside the lipid rafts , as determined by sucrose density gradient sedimentation . In Jurkat T cells , approximately 5 - - 10 % of Src homology 2 domain - containing tyrosine phosphatase ( SHP - 1 ) is constitutively associated with plasma membrane , and nearly 50 % of SHP - 2 is translocated to plasma membrane after vanadate treatment . Similar to transmembrane PTP , CD45 , the membrane - associated populations of SHP - 1 and SHP - 2 are essentially excluded from lipid rafts , where other signaling molecules such as Lck , linker for activation of T cells , and CD3 zeta are enriched . We further demonstrated that CD3 - induced tyrosine phosphorylation of these substrates is largely restricted to lipid rafts , unless PTPs are inhibited . It suggests that a restricted partition of PTPs among membrane subdomains may regulate protein tyrosine phosphorylation in T cell membrane . To test this hypothesis , we targeted SHP - 1 into lipid rafts by using the N - terminal region of Lck ( residues 1 - - 14 ) . The results indicate that the expression of Lck / SHP - 1 chimera inside lipid rafts profoundly inhibits CD3 - induced tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3 zeta / epsilon , IL - 2 generation , and nuclear mobilization of NF - AT . Collectively , these results suggest that the exclusion of PTPs from lipid rafts may be a mechanism that potentiates TCR / CD3 activation An instructive component in T helper cell type 2 ( Th2 ) development mediated by GATA - 3 . Although interleukin ( IL ) - 12 and IL - 4 polarize naive CD4 ( + ) T cells toward T helper cell type 1 ( Th1 ) or Th2 phenotypes , it is not known whether cytokines instruct the developmental fate in uncommitted progenitors or select for outgrowth of cells that have stochastically committed to a particular fate . To distinguish these instructive and selective models , we used surface affinity matrix technology to isolate committed progenitors based on cytokine secretion phenotype and developed retroviral - based tagging approaches to directly monitor individual progenitor fate decisions at the clonal and population levels . We observe IL - 4 - dependent redirection of phenotype in cells that have already committed to a non - IL - 4 - producing fate , inconsistent with predictions of the selective model . Further , retroviral tagging of naive progenitors with the Th2 - specific transcription factor GATA - 3 provided direct evidence for instructive differentiation , and no evidence for the selective outgrowth of cells committed to either the Th1 or Th2 fate . These data would seem to exclude selection as an exclusive mechanism in Th1 / Th2 differentiation , and support an instructive model of cytokine - driven transcriptional programming of cell fate decisions . In vitro - activated human lupus T cells express normal estrogen receptor proteins which bind to the estrogen response element . We have shown that estrogen receptor ( ERalpha , ERbeta ) transcripts are expressed in SLE and normal T cells . In this study , T cell nuclear extracts from female lupus patients and normal donors were tested for biologically active ER proteins capable of binding to the human estrogen response element ( hERE ) by electrophoretic mobility shift assays . When peripheral blood T cells were stimulated with 17beta - estradiol ( E2 ) , PMA and ionomycin , two major retarded bands in T cell nuclear extracts exhibited a migration pattern similar to slow migrating protein - ERE complexes in human breast cancer cell extracts . T cells cultured only with E2 did not have these complexes . The formation of the complexes was inhibited by competition with the hERE cold oligonucleotide and partially with anti - ERalpha antibodies . There was no notable difference in the migration pattern of ERE - binding proteins between the SLE and normal T cell extracts . Together , these results suggest that activated human T cells , whether lupus - derived or normal - derived , contain biologically active ERalpha proteins . Other factors may be responsible for differential sensitivity of lupus T cells to estrogen . Mechanism of the inhibitory effect of protease inhibitor on tumor necrosis factor alpha production of monocytes . If the inflammatory response becomes excessive or uncontrolled by some stimuli , inappropriate inflammatory responses occur . Monocytes are extremely important cells for regulating the cytokine network and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFalpha ) and interleukin - ( IL ) 10 , which are mainly synthesized by monocytes , are representative cytokines that play a central role in the cytokine network . Protease inhibitors such as gabexate mesilate ( GM ) and ulinastatin ( UTI ) have been shown to have various beneficial effects by inhibiting the activation of leukocytes , but the mechanism for this has yet to be fully elucidated . In this study we investigated the mechanism of the inhibitory effect of protease inhibitors on the proinflammatory cytokine production of lipopolysaccharide - ( LPS ) stimulated monocytes . LPS - stimulated monocytes were treated with GM or UTI . The value of TNFalpha and IL - 10 in the culture medium of monocytes was measured and each mRNA expression was assayed . The inhibitory effect of protease inhibitors on the activity of intracellular signal transduction pathways such as protein kinase C ( PKC ) and nuclear factor kappa B ( NFkappaB ) were also evaluated . GM decreased the TNFalpha production of LPS - stimulated monocytes as shown by the inhibition of mRNA expression and increased the IL - 10 production of LPS - stimulated monocytes . GM also suppressed the NFkappaB activity of LPS - stimulated monocytes . UTI decreased the TNFalpha production of LPS - stimulated monocytes , but did not inhibit the TNFalpha mRNA expression . The present study shows that the inhibitory effect of GM on the TNFalpha production of activated human monocytes is mediated by the suppression of NFkappaB activation , while the mechanism of UTI inhibiting TNFalpha production of human monocytes may be due to the inhibition of either the translation or secretion of TNFalpha . Homocysteine stimulates the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1 in endothelial cells leading to enhanced monocyte chemotaxis . Hyperhomocysteinemia has been identified as an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis . The infiltration of monocytes into the arterial wall is one of the key events during atherogenesis . Monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1 ( MCP - 1 ) is a potent chemokine that stimulates the migration of monocytes into the intima of the arterial wall . The mechanism by which increased monocyte infiltration occurs in atherosclerotic lesions in patients with hyperhomocysteinemia has not been delineated . The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of homocysteine on MCP - 1 production in endothelial cells . Cells were incubated with homocysteine . The secretion of MCP - 1 protein was significantly increased ( 195 % as compared to the control ) in cells treated with pathological concentrations of homocysteine . Such effect was accompanied by an increased expression of MCP - 1 mRNA ( 176 % as compared to the control ) in endothelial cells which resulted in enhanced monocyte chemotaxis . The p38 MAP kinase as well as other members of the p38 MAP kinase pathway , including MKK3 , MKK6 , ATF - 2 and Elk - 1 , were activated in homocysteine - treated cells . Homocysteine - induced MCP - 1 expression and subsequent monocyte chemotaxis were blocked by a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor ( SB203580 ) suggesting that the p38 MAP kinase pathway might be involved in homocysteine - induced MCP - 1 expression in endothelial cells . In contrast , staurosporine , a protein kinase C inhibitor , had no effect on homocysteine - induced MCP - 1 expression . In conclusion , our results indicate that homocysteine stimulates MCP - 1 expression in endothelial cells leading to enhanced monocyte chemotaxis . Inducible resistance to Fas - mediated apoptosis in B cells . Apoptosis produced in B cells through Fas ( APO - 1 , CD95 ) triggering is regulated by signals derived from other surface receptors : CD40 engagement produces upregulation of Fas expression and marked susceptibility to Fas - induced cell death , whereas antigen receptor engagement , or IL - 4R engagement , inhibits Fas killing and in so doing induces a state of Fas - resistance , even in otherwise sensitive , CD40 - stimulated targets . Surface immunoglobulin and IL - 4R utilize at least partially distinct pathways to produce Fas - resistance that differentially depend on PKC and STAT6 , respectively . Further , surface immunoglobulin signaling for inducible Fas - resistance bypasses Btk , requires NF - kappaB , and entails new macromolecular synthesis . Terminal effectors of B cell Fas - resistance include the known anti - apoptotic gene products , Bcl - xL and FLIP , and a novel anti - apoptotic gene that encodes FAIM ( Fas Apoptosis Inhibitory Molecule ) . faim was identified by differential display and exists in two alternatively spliced forms ; faim - S is broadly expressed , but faim - L expression is tissue - specific . The FAIM sequence is highly evolu - tionarily conserved , suggesting an important role for this molecule throughout phylogeny . Inducible resistance to Fas killing is hypothesized to protect foreign antigen - specific B cells during potentially hazardous interactions with FasL - bearing T cells , whereas autoreactive B cells fail to become Fas - resistant and are deleted via Fas - dependent cytotoxicity . Inadvertent or aberrant acquisition of Fas - resistance may permit autoreactive B cells to escape Fas deletion , and malignant lymphocytes to impede anti - tumor immunity . Stromal cell - derived factor 1 alpha - induced chemotaxis in T cells is mediated by nitric oxide signaling pathways . Stromal cell - derived factor 1 alpha ( SDF1 alpha ) and its cognate chemokine receptor CXCR4 act as potent chemoattractants and regulate trafficking and homing of hematopoietic progenitor cells and lymphocytes . However , the molecular mechanisms regulating SDF1 alpha - driven cell migration are not well defined . In this study , we have explored the roles of the second messenger NO and the transcription factor NF - kappa B in SDF1 alpha - induced T cell migration . SDF1 alpha treatment of Jurkat T cells increased the activity of NO synthase , which catalyzes the generation of NO . We observed that pretreatment of Jurkat cells or activated PBLs with several NO donors significantly enhanced the SDF1 alpha - induced migration , whereas various inhibitors of NO synthase markedly abrogated the chemotactic response in a concentration - dependent manner . Furthermore , we observed that inhibitors of the transcription factor NF - kappa B , which is linked to NO signaling pathways , also significantly blocked the SDF1 alpha - induced chemotactic response . However , these compounds did not have a significant effect on SDF1 alpha - induced mitogen - activated protein kinase activity . In addition , the MAP / Erk kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 did not abrogate SDF1 alpha - induced chemotaxis . AKT , which has been shown to mediate NO production , was also phosphorylated upon SDF1 alpha stimulation . These studies suggest that NO - related signaling pathways may mediate SDF1 alpha - induced chemotaxis , but not mitogen - activated protein kinase activation . The lack of NF - kappa B transactivation and PKC epsilon expression in CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( + ) thymocytes correlates with negative selection . Deletion of autoreactive thymocytes at the DP stage is the basis for tolerance to thymus - expressed self antigens . In this study we investigated whether distinct signalling pathways are induced in DP thymocytes as compared to mature T cells upon stimulation with antigen . Using triple transgenic mice expressing a TCR transgene , dominant negative ras / Mek proteins and a reporter gene construct with AP - 1 or NF - kappa B binding sites , we showed a complete lack of transcriptional activity of NF - kappa B but not AP - 1 in DP thymocytes , whereas both were transcriptionally active in mature T cells after antigenic stimulation . Lack of NF - kappa B induction correlated with increased death in response to antigen . AP - 1 induction was dependent on the integrity of the ras / Mek pathway indicating that this pathway was activated in the DP thymocytes . In contrast , we found a complete lack of constitutive expression of the epsilon isoform of Protein Kinase C ( PKC ) in DP thymocytes , although it was present in mature thymocytes and peripheral T cells . Taken together the results suggest that the lack of PKC epsilon in DP thymocytes could lead to the absence of NF - kappa B activity after antigenic stimulation contributing to negative selection . Cell Death and Differentiation ( 2000 ) 7 , 1253 - 1262 . CD2 stimulation leads to the delayed and prolonged activation of STAT1 in T cells but not NK cells . OBJECTIVE : T lymphocytes can be activated by soluble factors such as cytokines or through direct cell - cell interactions . Although cytokine receptors are known to signal through STAT family transcription factors , the mechanisms by which other cell - surface molecules , such as CD2 , transduce signals is unclear . The goal of this study was to determine whether stimulation of T cells through CD2 recapitulates aspects of cytokine - induced T - cell activation by use of STAT transcription factors . MATERIALS AND METHODS : T cells were treated with anti - CD2 antibodies or cells bearing the natural CD2 ligand CD58 , after which signaling through STAT transcription factors was assessed . RESULTS : Stimulation of CD2 on primary T lymphocytes leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation , nuclear translocation , and DNA binding of STAT1 . In contrast to stimulation by cytokines , the activation of STAT1 in response to CD2 ligation is delayed and does not involve Jak kinases . Furthermore , while STAT phosphorylation induced by cytokines is generally transient , STAT1 phosphorylation following CD2 stimulation persists for a period of days . Transcription of key target genes such as IRF1 and c - fos proceeds with delayed kinetics following CD2 stimulation , suggesting that this unique pattern of STAT activation may lead to a distinct cellular response following CD2 ligation . This pathway appears to be restricted to T cells , as stimulation of CD2 on NK cells does not lead to STAT1 activation . CONCLUSION : Stimulation of T cells through cell - surface molecules such as CD2 involves activation of STAT transcription factors , thus recapitulating elements of cytokine signaling . NFATc1 and NFATc2 together control both T and B cell activation and differentiation . NFAT transcription factors play critical roles in gene transcription during immune responses . To investigate further the two most prominent NFAT family members , NFATc1 and NFATc2 , we generated mice bearing lymphoid systems devoid of both . Doubly deficient T cells displayed cell surface markers of activation yet were significantly deficient in the development of multiple effector functions , including Th cytokine production , surface effector molecule expression , and cytolytic activity . Nevertheless , doubly deficient B cells were hyperactivated , as evidenced by extremely elevated serum IgG1 and IgE , as well as plasma cell expansion and infiltration of end organs . Thus , in T cells , NFATc1 and NFATc2 are dispensable for inflammatory reactivity but are required for effector differentiation , while in B cells , NFATs regulate both normal homeostasis and differentiation . Epstein - barr virus immediate - early protein BZLF1 is SUMO - 1 modified and disrupts promyelocytic leukemia bodies . Although the immediate - early proteins of both herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) and cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) are known to modify promyelocytic leukemia ( PML ) ( ND10 ) bodies in the nucleus of the host cell , it has been unclear whether lytic infection with gamma herpesviruses induces a similar effect . The PML protein is induced by interferon , involved in major histocompatibility complex class I presentation , and necessary for certain types of apoptosis . Therefore , it is likely that PML bodies function in an antiviral capacity . SUMO - 1 modification of PML is known to be required for the formation of PML bodies . To examine whether Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) lytic replication interferes with PML bodies , we expressed the EBV immediate - early genes BZLF1 ( Z ) and BRLF1 ( R ) in EBV - positive cell lines and examined PML localization . Both Z and R expression resulted in PML dispersion in EBV - positive cells . Z but not R expression is sufficient to disrupt PML bodies in EBV - negative cell lines . We show that dispersion of PML bodies by Z requires a portion of the transcriptional activation domain of Z but not the DNA - binding function . As was previously reported for the HSV - 1 ICP0 and CMV IE1 proteins , Z reduces the amount of SUMO - 1 - modified PML . We also found that Z itself is SUMO - 1 modified ( through amino acid 12 ) and that Z competes with PML for limiting amounts of SUMO - 1 . These results suggest that disruption of PML bodies is important for efficient lytic replication of EBV . Furthermore , Z may potentially alter the function of a variety of cellular proteins by inhibiting SUMO - 1 modification Suppression of nuclear factor - kappaB and stimulation of inhibitor kappaB by troglitazone : evidence for an anti - inflammatory effect and a potential antiatherosclerotic effect in the obese . To elucidate whether troglitazone exerts an antiinflammatory effect in humans , in vivo , we investigated the suppression of nuclear factor kappaB ( NFkappaB ) in mononuclear cells ( MNC ) by this drug . We measured intranuclear NFkappaB , total cellular NFkappaB , inhibitor kappaB ( IkappaB ) alpha , reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) generation , and p47 ( phox ) subunit ( a key component protein of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase ) in MNC . Plasma tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - alpha , soluble intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 ( sICAM - 1 ) , monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1 ( MCP - 1 ) , plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 ( PAI - 1 ) , C - reactive protein ( CRP ) , and interleukin ( IL ) - 10 ( antiinflammatory cytokine ) concentrations were also measured as mediators of inflammatory activity that are regulated by the proinflammatory transcription factor NFkappaB . Seven nondiabetic obese patients were given 400 mg troglitazone daily for 4 weeks . Blood samples were collected before and at weekly intervals thereafter . MNC were separated ; and the levels of intranuclear NFkappaB , total cellular NFkappaB , IkappaBalpha , and p47 ( phox ) subunit and ROS generation were determined . Plasma was used to measure insulin glucose , TNFalpha , sICAM , MCP - 1 , PAI - 1 , CRP , and IL - 10 . Plasma insulin concentrations fell significantly at week 1 , from 31 . 2 + / - 29 . 1 to 14 . 2 + / - 11 . 4 mU / L ( P < 0 . 01 ) and remained low throughout 4 weeks . Plasma glucose concentrations did not alter significantly . There was a fall in intranuclear NFkappaB , total cellular NFkappaB , and p47 ( phox ) subunit , with an increase in cellular IkappaBalpha at week 2 , which persisted until week 4 . There was a parallel fall in ROS generation by MNC at week 1 ; this progressed and persisted until week 4 ( P < 0 . 001 ) . Plasma TNF - alpha , sICAM - 1 , MCP - 1 , and PAI - 1 concentrations fell significantly at week 4 . Plasma IL - 10 concentration increased significantly , whereas plasma CRP concentrations decreased . We conclude that troglitazone has an antiinflammatory action that may contribute to its putative antiatherosclerotic effects . Tyrosine phosphorylation - dependent activation of NF - kappa B . Requirement for p56 LCK and ZAP - 70 protein tyrosine kinases . Phosphorylation of the N - terminal domain of I kappa B inhibitory subunits induces activation of the transcription factor NF - kappa B . Although serine phosphorylation has been shown to induce ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome - mediated degradation of I kappa B - alpha , little is known about the mechanisms that lead to release of active NF - kappa B in T cells as a consequence of tyrosine phosphorylation of I kappa B - alpha [ Imbert , V . , Rupec , R . A . , Livolsi , A . , Pahl , H . L . , Traenckner , B . M . , Mueller - Dieckmann , C . , Farahifar , D . , Rossi , B . , Auberger , P . , Baeuerle , P . & Peyron , J . F . ( 1996 ) Cell 86 , 787 - - 798 ] . The involvement of the tyrosine kinases p56 ( lck ) and ZAP - 70 in this reaction is demonstrated here using specific pharmacological inhibitors and Jurkat mutants unable to express these kinases . Although the inhibitors prevented both pervanadate - induced phosphorylation of I kappa B - alpha on Tyr42 and NF - kappa B activation , we observed that , in p56 ( lck ) - deficient Jurkat mutants , NF - kappa B could still associate with I kappa B - alpha despite phosphorylation on Tyr42 . Furthermore , the SH2 domain of p56 ( lck ) appeared to be required for pervanadate - induced NF - kappa B activation but not for Tyr42 phosphorylation . These results show that p56 ( lck ) and ZAP - 70 are key components of the signaling pathway that leads to phosphotyrosine - dependent NF - kappa B activation in T cells and confirm that tyrosine kinases must control at least two different steps to induce activation of NF - kappa B . Finally , we show that H ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) , which stimulates p56 ( lck ) and ZAP - 70 in T cells , is an activator of NF - kappa B through tyrosine phosphorylation of I kappa B - alpha . Specific missense mutations in NEMO result in hyper - IgM syndrome with hypohydrotic ectodermal dysplasia . The gene that encodes nuclear factor kappaB ( NF - kappaB ) essential modulator ( or NEMO , also known as IKKgamma ) is required for activation of the transcription factor NF - kappaB . We describe mutations in the putative zinc - finger domain of NEMO that result in an X - linked primary immunodeficiency characterized by hyper - IgM syndrome and hypohydrotic ectodermal dysplasia ( XHM - ED ) . These mutations prevent CD40 ligand ( CD40L ) - mediated degradation of inhibitor of NF - kappaB alpha ( IkappaB - alpha ) and account for the following observations : B cells from XHM - ED patients are unable to undergo immunoglobulin class - switch recombination and antigen - presenting cells ( APCs ) are unable to synthesize the NF - kappaB - regulated cytokines interleukin 12 ( IL - 12 ) or tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - alpha ) when stimulated with CD40L . Nevertheless , innate immunity is preserved in XHM - ED patients because APCs retain the capacity to respond to stimulation by lipopolysaccharide or Staphylococcus aureus Cowan ' s antigen ( SAC ) . Overall , the phenotype observed in XHM - ED patients shows that the putative zinc - finger domain of NEMO has a regulatory function and demonstrates the definite requirement of CD40 - mediated NF - kappaB activation for B cell immunoglobulin class - switching . Granulocytic differentiation of human NB4 promyelocytic leukemia cells induced by all - trans retinoic acid metabolites . The metabolism of all - trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) has been reported to be partly responsible for the in vivo resistance to ATRA seen in the treatment of human acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) . However , ATRA metabolism appears to be involved in the growth inhibition of several cancer cell lines in vitro . The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of the principal metabolites of ATRA [ 4 - hydroxy - retinoic acid ( 4 - OH - RA ) , 18 - hydroxy - retinoic acid ( 18 - OH - RA ) , 4 - oxo - retinoic acid ( 4 - oxo - RA ) , and 5 , 6 - epoxy - retinoic acid ( 5 , 6 - epoxy - RA ) ] in NB4 , a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line that exhibits the APL diagnostic t ( 15 ; 17 ) chromosomal translocation and expresses the PML - RAR alpha fusion protein . We established that the four ATRA metabolites were indeed formed by the NB4 cells in vitro . NB4 cell growth was inhibited ( 69 - 78 % at 120 h ) and cell cycle progression in the G1 phase ( 82 - 85 % at 120 h ) was blocked by ATRA and all of the metabolites at 1 microM concentration . ATRA and its metabolites could induce NB4 cells differentiation with similar activity , as evaluated by cell morphology , by the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test ( 82 - 88 % at 120 h ) or by the expression of the maturation specific cell surface marker CD11c . In addition , nuclear body reorganization to macropunctated structures , as well as the degradation of PML - RAR alpha , was found to be similar for ATRA and all of its metabolites . Comparison of the relative potency of the retinoids using the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test showed effective concentrations required to differentiate 50 % of cells in 72 h as follows : ATRA , 15 . 8 + / - 1 . 7 nM ; 4 - oxo - RA , 38 . 3 + / - 1 . 3 nM ; 18 - OH - RA , 55 . 5 + / - 1 . 8 nM ; 4 - OH - RA , 79 . 8 + / - 1 . 8 nM ; and 5 , 6 - epoxy - RA , 99 . 5 + / - 1 . 5 nM . The ATRA metabolites were found to exert their differentiation effects via the RAR alpha nuclear receptors , because the RAR alpha - specific antagonist BMS614 blocked metabolite - induced CD11c expression in NB4 cells . These data demonstrate that the principal ATRA Phase 1 metabolites can elicit leukemia cell growth inhibition and differentiation in vitro through the RAR alpha signaling pathway , and they suggest that these metabolites may play a role in ATRA antileukemic activity in vivo . Expression of oestrogen and progesterone receptors by mast cells alone , but not lymphocytes , macrophages or other immune cells in human upper airways . BACKGROUND : Nasal polyposis often coexists with asthma in airway inflammatory conditions characterised by the infiltration of a range of immune cells . A potentially important role for ovarian hormones has been implicated in airway inflammation but the cellular target for such action is not known . METHODS : Expression of oestrogen receptors ( ER ) and progesterone receptors ( PR ) was examined using immunohistochemistry in formalin fixed nasal polyp tissues from 47 subjects . The cells positive for ER or PR were confirmed by spatial location , dual immunolabelling , and histochemical staining . RESULTS : Consistent with the known features of nasal polyps , CD4 + ( T helper / inducer ) , CD8 + ( cytotoxic / suppressor ) , CD68 + ( macrophages ) , mast cells , eosinophils and neutrophils were all clearly detected by their relevant monoclonal antibodies or appropriate histochemical staining , but only mast cells tested positive for ER / PR labelling with their polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies . The frequencies for expression were 61 . 7 % for ER positive and 59 . 6 % for PR positive cells . The expression of ER / PR was independent of patient sex and age but was highly correlated with the numbers of mast cells ( r = 0 . 973 , p < 0 . 001 for ER ; r = 0 . 955 , p < 0 . 001 for PR ) . Fewer than 5 % of mast cells were found to be negative for ER / PR expression . CONCLUSIONS : Mast cells alone , but not lymphocytes , macrophages , or other immune cells , express ER / PR in human upper airways . Numerous ER / PR positive mast cells exist in nasal polyps , indicating that this may be a major route for the involvement of sex hormones in airway inflammation when exposed to the higher and varying concentration of oestrogen and progesterone characteristic of females . NF kappa b signaling in posthypoxic endothelial cells : relevance to E - selectin expression and neutrophil adhesion . Our previous studies have implicated the nuclear transcription factor kappa B ( NF kappa B ) in the regulation of adhesion molecule expression in endothelial cells exposed to anoxia - reoxygenation ( A / R ) or a redox imbalance . The objectives of this study were ( 1 ) to define the kinetics of NF kappa B activation by examining I kappa B alpha degradation and the nuclear translocation of p65 in response to A / R or redox imbalance ( induced by treatment of cells with diamide and buthionine sulfoximine ) and ( 2 ) to determine whether the signal for I kappa B alpha degradation , nuclear translocation of p65 , and E - selectin - mediated neutrophil adhesion is related to the activity of protein tyrosine kinase ( PTK ) , protein tyrosine phosphatase ( PTPase ) and / or protein kinase C ( PKC ) . The results demonstrate that both A / R and redox imbalance led to I kappa B alpha degradation within 30 min and the concomitant appearance of p65 in the nucleus , consistent with rapid cytosolic activation of NF kappa B and subsequent nuclear translocation of the activated p65 subunit . Inhibition of PKC blocked I kappa B alpha degradation and p65 translocation in A / R - challenged , but not redox - altered , endothelial cells . However , both A / R - and redox - induced NF kappa B activation was blocked by inhibition of PTK . Similarly , A / R - induced E - selectin expression and neutrophil - endothelial cell adhesion were blocked by inhibition of PKC or PTK , while only PTK inhibited the redox - induced adhesion response . Pretreatment of cells with N - acetyl cysteine effectively blocked A / R - or redox - induced I kappa B degradation and significantly attenuated the respective neutrophil adhesion responses . Collectively , these findings indicate that A / R - induced E - selectin expression and neutrophil - endothelial cell adhesion are mediated by both PKC and PTK , which signal rapid activation of NF kappa B . This A / R - induced NF kappa B signaling response appears to be mediated , at least in part , by intracellular redox imbalance . Copyright 2001 S . Karger AG , Basel Induction of apoptosis in human lymphocytes by the herbicide 2 , 4 - dichlorophenoxyaceti acid . Dimethylammonium salt of 2 , 4 - dichlorophenoxyaceti acid ( DMA - 2 , 4 - D ) is a widely used herbicide that is considered moderately toxic . In the present study we found that DMA - 2 , 4 - D is able to cause apoptosis in peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy individuals and Jurkat T cells . Apoptosis induced by DMA - 2 , 4 - D was dose and time dependent , independent of Fas , TNF receptor 1 or the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor , and involved disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and activation of caspase - 9 . ZVAD - FMK , a broad - spectrum inhibitor of caspases , blocked DMA - 2 , 4 - D - induced apoptosis completely . While an inhibitor of caspase - 9 , as well as caspase - 9 and caspase - 3 inhibitors in combination , strongly blocked DMA - 2 , 4 - D - induced apoptosis , an inhibitor of caspase - 3 had a moderate inhibitory effect . Unlike Fas - mediated apoptosis , the initiator caspase , caspase - 8 , was not involved in DMA - 2 , 4 - D - induced apoptosis . Transfection of Jurkat cells with Bcl - 2 prevented DMA - 2 , 4 - D - induced disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and led to a complete blockage of apoptosis . Our data indicate that DMA - 2 , 4 - D kills human lymphocytes by initiating apoptosis via a direct effect on mitochondria . The activation of caspases occurs downstream of mitochondrial damage , and the dysfunction of mitochondria appears to be sufficient for triggering all downstream events leading to apoptosis . Inhibition of Th1 differentiation by IL - 6 is mediated by SOCS1 . Interleukin 6 ( IL - 6 ) is a cytokine produced by immune and nonimmune cells and exhibits functional pleiotropy and redundancy . IL - 6 plays an important role in the differentiation of several cell types . Here , we describe a novel function of IL - 6 : the negative regulation of CD4 + Th1 cell differentiation . While IL - 6 - directed CD4 + Th2 differentiation is mediated by IL - 4 , inhibition of Th1 differentiation by IL - 6 is independent of IL - 4 . IL - 6 upregulates suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 ( SOCS1 ) expression in activated CD4 + T cells , thereby interfering with signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 ( STAT1 ) phosphorylation induced by interferon gamma ( IFNgamma ) . Inhibition of IFNgamma receptor - mediated signals by IL - 6 prevents autoregulation of IFNgamma gene expression by IFNgamma during CD4 + T cell activation , thereby preventing Th1 differentiation . Thus , IL - 6 promotes CD4 + Th2 differentiation and inhibits Th1 differentiation by two independent molecular mechanisms . Interaction between CCAAT / enhancer binding protein and cyclic AMP response element binding protein 1 regulates human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transcription in cells of the monocyte / macrophage lineage . Recent observations have shown two CCAAT / enhancer binding protein ( C / EBP ) binding sites to be critically important for efficient human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) replication within cells of the monocyte / macrophage lineage , a cell type likely involved in transport of the virus to the brain . Additionally , sequence variation at C / EBP site I , which lies immediately upstream of the distal nuclear factor kappa B site and immediately downstream of a binding site for activating transcription factor ( ATF ) / cyclic AMP response element binding protein ( CREB ) , has been shown to affect HIV - 1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) activity . Given that C / EBP proteins have been shown to interact with many other transcription factors including members of the ATF / CREB family , we proceeded to determine whether an adjacent ATF / CREB binding site could affect C / EBP protein binding to C / EBP site I . Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses indicated that selected ATF / CREB site variants assisted in the recruitment of C / EBP proteins to an adjacent , naturally occurring , low - affinity C / EBP site . This biophysical interaction appears to occur via at least two mechanisms . First , low amounts of CREB - 1 and C / EBP appear to heterodimerize and bind to a site consisting of a half site from both the ATF / CREB and C / EBP binding sites . In addition , CREB - 1 homodimers bind to the ATF / CREB site and recruit C / EBP dimers to their cognate weak binding sites . This interaction is reciprocal , since C / EBP dimer binding to a strong C / EBP site leads to enhanced CREB - 1 recruitment to ATF / CREB sites that are weakly bound by CREB . Sequence variation at both C / EBP and ATF / CREB sites affects the molecular interactions involved in mediating both of these mechanisms . Most importantly , sequence variation at the ATF / CREB binding site affected basal LTR activity as well as LTR function following interleukin - 6 stimulation , a treatment that leads to increases in C / EBP activation . Thus , HIV - 1 LTR ATF / CREB binding site sequence variation may modulate cellular signaling at the viral promoter through the C / EBP pathway Selective inhibition of interleukin - 4 gene expression in human T cells by aspirin . Previous studies indicated that aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid [ ASA ] ) can have profound immunomodulatory effects by regulating cytokine gene expression in several types of cells . This study is the first in which concentrations of ASA in the therapeutic range were found to significantly reduce interleukin ( IL ) - 4 secretion and RNA expression in freshly isolated and mitogen - primed human CD4 + T cells . In contrast , ASA did not affect IL - 13 , interferon - gamma , and IL - 2 expression . ASA inhibited IL - 4 , but not IL - 2 , promoter - driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression in transiently transfected Jurkat T cells . The structurally unrelated nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs indomethacin and flurbiprofen did not affect cytokine gene expression in T cells , whereas the weak cyclo - oxygenase inhibitor salicylic acid was at least as effective as ASA in inhibiting IL - 4 expression and promoter activity . The inhibitory effect of ASA on IL - 4 transcription was not mediated by decreased nuclear expression of the known salicylate target nuclear factor ( NF ) - kappaB and was accompanied by reduced binding of an inducible factor to an IL - 4 promoter region upstream of , but not overlapping , the NF of activated T cells - and NF - kappaB - binding P1 element . It is concluded that anti - inflammatory salicylates , by means of a previously unrecognized mechanism of action , can influence the nature of adaptive immune responses by selectively inhibiting the expression of IL - 4 , a critical effector of these responses , in CD4 + T cells . Molecular and cellular mediators of interleukin - 1 - dependent acute inflammatory arthritis . OBJECTIVE : To examine the molecular and cellular mechanisms in a model of acute inflammatory monarticular arthritis induced by methylated bovine serum albumin ( mBSA ) and interleukin - 1 ( IL - 1 ) . METHODS : Mice were injected intraarticularly with mBSA on day 0 and subcutaneously with recombinant human IL - 1beta on days 0 - 2 . At day 7 , knee joints were removed and assessed histologically . Flow cytometry and RNase protection were used to analyze IL - 1 - dependent events . RESULTS : C57BL / 6 ( B6 ) , 129 / Sv , and ( B6 x 129 / Sv ) F1 hybrid mice , all H - 2b strains , were susceptible to mBSA / IL - 1 - induced arthritis , whereas C3H / HeJ ( H - 2k ) mice were not . B6 mice lacking T and B cells ( RAG1 - / - ) or major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II antigens ( MHCII - / - ) , and B6 mice treated with a CD4 + T cell - depleting monoclonal antibody , were resistant to disease . In contrast , B cell - deficient ( muMT / muMT ) mice developed arthritis at an incidence and severity similar to that of controls . RelB - deficient ( RelB - / - ) bone marrow chimeric mice had arthritis that was significantly reduced in incidence and severity . In B6 mice , flow cytometry demonstrated an IL - 1 - dependent leukocyte infiltration into the synovial compartment and RNase protection assays revealed induction of messenger RNA ( mRNA ) for the chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 , macrophage inhibitory protein 2 ( MIP - 2 ) , RANTES , MIP - 1alpha , and MIP - 1beta , in vivo and in vitro . CONCLUSION : Arthritis induced by mBSA / IL - 1 is strain specific and dependent on CD4 + T lymphocytes and at least partially on RelB , but not on B lymphocytes or antibody . IL - 1 contributes to leukocyte recruitment to the synovium and directly induces chemokine mRNA production by synovial cells . This model of acute monarticular arthritis is particularly suitable for further investigations into cell - mediated immunity in arthritis and the role of IL - 1 . Positive and negative regulation of granulopoiesis by endogenous RARalpha . Acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) is always associated with chromosomal translocations that disrupt the retinoic acid receptor alpha ( RARalpha ) gene . Whether these translocations relate to a role for endogenous RARalpha in normal granulopoiesis remains uncertain because most studies addressing this question have used non - physiological overexpression systems . Granulocyte differentiation in cells derived from RARalpha - deficient ( RARalpha ( - / - ) ) mice was studied and evaluated in the context of agonist - bound and ligand - free RARalpha . Our results demonstrate that RARalpha is dispensable for granulopoiesis , as RARalpha ( - / - ) mice have a normal granulocyte population despite an impaired ability to respond to retinoids . However , although it is not absolutely required , RARalpha can bidirectionally modulate granulopoiesis . RARalpha stimulates differentiation in response to exogenous retinoic acid . Furthermore , endogenous retinoids control granulopoiesis in vivo , as either vitamin A - deficient mice or animals treated with an RAR antagonist accumulate more immature granulocytes in their bone marrow . Conversely , RARalpha acts to limit differentiation in the absence of ligand because granulocyte precursors from RARalpha ( - / - ) mice differentiate earlier in culture . Thus , the block in granulopoiesis exerted by RARalpha fusion proteins expressed in APL cells may correspond to an amplification of a normal function of unliganded RARalpha . Expression and function of a stem cell promoter for the murine CBFalpha2 gene : distinct roles and regulation in natural killer and T cell development . The Runt family transcription factor CBFalpha2 ( AML1 , PEBP2alphaB , or Runx1 ) is required by hematopoietic stem cells and expressed at high levels in T - lineage cells . In human T cells CBFalpha2 is usually transcribed from a different promoter ( distal promoter ) than in myeloid cells ( proximal promoter ) , but the developmental and functional significance of this promoter switch has not been known . Here , we report that both coding and noncoding sequences of the distal 5 ' end are highly conserved between the human and the murine genes , and the distal promoter is responsible for the overwhelming majority of CBFalpha2 expression in murine hematopoietic stem cells as well as in T cells . Distal promoter activity is maintained throughout T cell development and at lower levels in B cell development , but downregulated in natural killer cell development . The distal N - terminal isoform binds to functionally important regulatory sites from known target genes with two - to threefold higher affinity than the proximal N - terminal isoform . Neither full - length isoform alters growth of a myeloid cell line under nondifferentiating conditions , but the proximal isoform selectively delays mitotic arrest of the cell line under differentiating conditions , resulting in the generation of greater numbers of neutrophils . Constitutive PI3 - K activity is essential for proliferation , but not survival , of Theileria parva - transformed B cells . Theileria is an intracellular parasite that causes lymphoproliferative disorders in cattle , and infection of leucocytes induces a transformed phenotype similar to tumour cells , but the mechanisms by which the parasite induces this phenotype are not understood . Here , we show that infected B lymphocytes display constitutive phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3 - K ) activity , which appears to be necessary for proliferation , but not survival . Importantly , we demonstrate that one mechanism by which PI3 - K mediates the proliferation of infected B lymphocytes is through the induction of a granulocyte - monocyte colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) - dependent autocrine loop . PI3 - K induction of GM - CSF appears to be at the transcriptional level and , consistently , we demonstrate that PI3 - K is also involved in the constitutive induction of AP - 1 and NF - kappaB , which characterizes Theileria - infected leucocytes . Taken together , our results highlight a novel strategy exploited by the intracellular parasite Theileria to induce continued proliferation of its host leucocyte . Lymphokine dependence of STAT3 activation produced by surface immunoglobulin cross - linking and by phorbol ester plus calcium ionophore treatment in B cells . Stimulation of B cells by surface immunoglobulin ( sIg ) triggering , or through the mitogenic combination of phorbol ester and calcium ionophore , is accompanied by activation of STAT transcription factors . The mechanism responsible for the delayed nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated STAT3 was examined in detail , focusing on the role of B cell - derived lymphokines . sIg - induced activation of STAT3 was partially inhibited in B cells obtained from IL - 6 - or IL - 10 - deficient mice , and was partially blocked by neutralizing antibodies directed against either of these lymphokines . sIg - induced STAT3 activation was completely inhibited by combining IL - 6 - and IL - 10 - specific neutralizing antibodies , or by adding individual neutralizing antibodies to B cells obtained from lymphokine - deficient animals . In contrast , IL - 10 alone appeared to account for STAT3 activation resulting from B cell stimulation with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore . In keeping with these results , soluble IL - 6 and IL - 10 were found in supernatant fluid obtained from stimulated B cells . This work indicates that a lymphokine pathway is responsible for STAT3 activation that occurs late after B cell stimulation , and points out differences in B cell activation that result from stimulation through the antigen receptor and through pharmacological mimicry of signaling mediators . Transcription factor AP - 4 is a ligand for immunoglobulin - kappa promoter E - box elements . Immunoglobulin ( Ig ) - kappa promoters from humans and mice share conserved sequences . The octamer element is common to all Ig promoters and pivotal for their function . However , other conserved sequence motifs , that differ between Ig variable gene families , are required for normal promoter function . These conserved motifs do not stimulate transcription in the absence of an octamer . One example is an E - box of the E47 / E12 type ( 5 ' - CAGCTG - 3 ' ) , which is found in all promoters of the human and murine Ig - kappa gene subgroups / families , with the exception of subgroups II and VI and their related murine families . In the present study we show that the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor AP - 4 , and not E47 , interacts specifically with the kappa promoter E - boxes when tested in electrophoretic mobility - shift assays using nuclear extracts derived from human and murine B - cell lines . Furthermore , AP - 4 , unlike E47 , did not act as a transactivator , which is in agreement with previous studies on intact kappa promoters , showing that transcription is absent when the octamer element has been mutated . Based on these data , and the conservation of the 5 ' - CAGCTG - 3 ' motif among human and murine kappa promoters , we propose that AP - 4 is the major ligand for Ig - kappa promoter E - boxes . A 16 - mer peptide ( RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK ) from antennapedia preferentially targets the Class I pathway . Translocation of antigenic peptides into the cytosol of antigen presenting cells facilitates proteosomal processing and loading into Class I molecules for MHC presentation on the cell surface . The DNA binding domain of the Drosophila transcription factor ( Antennapedia ) , a 60 amino acid protein , is rapidly taken up by cells and has been fused to selected antigens to enhance their immunogenicity . We now demonstrate that a 16 amino acid peptide from antennapedia can facilitate the cytoplasmic uptake of CTL epitope 9 - mer peptides . Synthetic peptides were made containing the 16 - mer antennapedia peptide linked in tandem to the ovalbumin SIINFEKL CTL peptide . The peptide complex was shown to rapidly internalise into APCs by confocal microscopy . This peptide induced CTL in C57BL / 6 mice and protected them against growth of an ovalbumin expressing tumour cell line ( E . G7 - OVA ) . The ability of the hybrid peptide to be processed and presented by APCs was similar , whether the SIINFEKL sequence was appended at the C - terminus or N - terminus of the Antennapedia peptide . The production of synthetic peptides containing other CTL peptide epitopes may be useful for priming CTLs in vitro and in vivo Bone marrow cells promote TH2 polarization and inhibit virus - specific CTL generation . This laboratory recently reported that human bone marrow cells ( BMC ) inhibit the generation of virus - specific CTL in culture . The culture supernatants contained increased levels of prostaglandin E ( 2 ) ( PGE ( 2 ) ) ( shown to favor TH2 cell development ) and also inhibited EBV - CTL effector cell development . In this study , we obtained PBL from Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) IgG antibody positive kidney transplant recipients ( R ) and their living - related donors ( LRD ) one year after renal transplantation . EBV - specific CTL were then generated in vitro by stimulating PBL with autologous EBV - transformed B cells ( EBV - B ) in the presence or absence of autologous BMC . The addition of BMC to the EBV - CTL generation cultures increased the intracellular expression in CD3 + cells of IL - 4 , - 5 , - 6 , - 10 , and - 13 . These CD3 + cells also expressed increased levels of the TH2 associated receptor CCR3 . Inhibition was even observed by preparing EBV - CTL generating cultures in trans - wells that separated the autologous BMC from the PBL + EBV - B . It was then observed that CD3 + cells obtained after 7 days of culture in the presence of autologous BMC could be used as inhibitors of EBV - CTL generation . Protein Kinase A ( PKA ) , a cAMP kinase that is involved in the upregulation of TH2 cytokine activity , was increased in EBV - CTL cultures by the presence of BMC . Additionally , IL - 4 - mediated signal transduction and activation of transcription ( STAT - 6 ) phosphorylation was slightly increased . These results show that the BMC inhibition is mediated by soluble factors ( cytokines ) and that cell - cell contact in this autologous system is not required , so that BMC ( at least partially , via cytokine production ) promote TH2 polarization in culture . Moreover , TH2 cells induced by culturing with autologous BMC directly inhibit EBV - CTL generation , and TH2 associated PKA , CCR3 , and STAT - 6 phosphorylation are enhanced by BMC . Reduction in DNA binding activity of the transcription factor Pax - 5a in B lymphocytes of aged mice . Aging has been associated with intrinsic changes of the humoral immune response , which may lead to an increased occurrence of autoimmune disorders and pathogenic susceptibility . The transcription factor Pax - 5 is a key regulator of B cell development . Pax - 5a / B cell - specific activator protein and an alternatively spliced isoform , Pax - 5d , may have opposing functions in transcriptional regulation due to the lack of a transactivation domain in Pax - 5d . To study B cell - specific changes that occur during the aging process , we investigated expression patterns of Pax - 5a and 5d in mature B cells of young and aged mice . RNase protection assays showed a similar transcriptional pattern for both age groups that indicates that aging has no affect on transcription initiation or alternative splicing for either isoform . In contrast , a significant reduction in the DNA binding activity of Pax - 5a but not Pax - 5d protein was observed in aged B cells in vitro , while Western blot analyses showed that similar levels of Pax - 5a and 5d proteins were present in both age groups . The observed decrease in Pax - 5a binding activity correlated with changes in expression of two Pax - 5 target genes in aged B cells . Expression of the Ig J chain and the secreted form of Ig mu , which are both known to be suppressed by Pax - 5a in mature B cells , were increased in B cells of aged mice . Together , our studies suggest that changes associated with the aging phenotype cause posttranslational modification ( s ) of Pax - 5a but not Pax - 5d , which may lead to an abnormal B cell phenotype in aged mice , associated with elevated levels of J chain , and secretion of IgM NF - kappa B / Rel participation in the lymphokine - dependent proliferation of T lymphoid cells . Proliferative responses of lymphoid cells to IL - 2 and IL - 4 depend on activation of the cells , but the mechanism ( s ) by which activation enhances cellular competence to respond to cytokines is not fully understood . The NF - kappaB / Rel family represents one signal transduction pathway induced during such activation . We show in this study that inhibition of NF - kappaB through the expression of an IkappaBalpha ( inhibitory protein that dissociates from NF - kappaB ) mutant refractory to signal - induced degradation ( IkappaBalpha ( DeltaN ) ) interfered with the acquisition of competence to proliferate in response to IL - 4 as well as IL - 2 . Thymocytes and T cells from IkappaBalpha ( DeltaN ) transgenic mice expressed normal levels of IL - 2R subunits . However , transgenic cells exhibited a dramatic defect in Stat5A activation treatment with IL - 2 , and a similar defect was observed for IL - 4 - induced Stat5 . In contrast , T lymphoid cells with inhibition of NF - kappaB showed normal insulin receptor substrate - 2 phosphorylation and only a modest decrease in Stat6 activation and insulin receptor substrate - 1 phosphorylation after IL - 4 stimulation . These results indicate that the NF - kappaB / Rel / IkappaBalpha system can regulate cytokine receptor capacitation through effects on the induction of downstream signaling by the Stat transcription factor family . BMS - 189453 , a novel retinoid receptor antagonist , is a potent testicular toxin . BMS - 189453 is a synthetic retinoid that acts as an antagonist at retinoic acid receptors alpha , beta , and gamma . In Sprague Dawley rats at daily oral doses of 15 , 60 , or 240 mg / kg for 1 month , BMS - 189453 produced increases in leukocyte counts , alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase levels , and marked testicular degeneration and atrophy at all doses . Significant overt signs of toxicity and deaths occurred at 240 mg / kg , whereas body - weight and food - consumption decreases occurred at 60 and 240 mg / kg . When BMS - 189453 was administered to male rats at daily doses ranging from 12 . 5 to 100 mg / kg for 1 week , only minimal testicular changes occurred at all doses , shortly after the dosing period . However , after a 1 - month drug - free observation period , marked testicular atrophy was evident at all doses . BMS - 189453 was then administered at doses of 2 , 10 , or 50 mg / kg to male rats for 1 , 3 , or 7 consecutive days . Dose - and duration - dependent testicular toxicity that occurred after a 1 - month observation period did not recover , and , in some cases , was more severe 4 months after the last dose . In rabbits administered BMS - 189453 at oral doses of 2 , 10 , or 50 mg / kg for 1 week , testicular degeneration and atrophy were evident in the high - dose group at 1 month following treatment . These studies indicate that retinoid antagonists can selectively produce progressive and prolonged testicular toxicity after single or repeated oral doses that are otherwise well tolerated . Sequential involvement of NFAT and Egr transcription factors in FasL regulation . The critical function of NFAT proteins in maintaining lymphoid homeostasis was revealed in mice lacking both NFATp and NFAT4 ( DKO ) . DKO mice exhibit increased lymphoproliferation , decreased activation - induced cell death , and impaired induction of FasL . The transcription factors Egr2 and Egr3 are potent activators of FasL expression . Here we find that Egr2 and Egr3 are NFAT target genes . Activation of FasL occurs via the NFAT - dependent induction of Egr3 , as demonstrated by the ability of exogenously provided NFATp to restore Egr - dependent FasL promoter activity in DKO lymph node cells . Further , Egr3 expression is enriched in Th1 cells , suggesting a molecular basis for the known preferential expression of FasL in the Th1 versus Th2 subset . Mechanisms and clinical relevance of nongenomic glucocorticoid actions . Glucocorticoids have profound anti - inflammatory and immunosuppressive actions when used therapeutically . The therapeutic dose is quite variable and depends on the disease , but ranges from very low to extremely high . The rationale for the use of various dosage regimens for specific clinical indications is the existence of three distinct , therapeutically relevant effects : genomic , specific nongenomic and unspecific nongenomic . Genomic effects are mediated by cytosolic receptors that alter expression of specific genes . Specific nongenomic effects occur within a few minutes and are mediated by steroid - selective membrane receptors . Unspecific nongenomic effects occur within seconds , but only at high glucocorticoid dosages , and seem to result from direct interactions with biological membranes . For unspecific nongenomic effects , methylprednisolone and other glucocorticoids have been shown to inhibit cation cycling across the plasma membrane , but to have little effect on protein synthesis . Thus , glucocorticoids could diminish or prevent the acute immune response by interfering with processes such as the rise in intracellular Ca2 + concentration . It is proposed that the additional therapeutic benefit of higher doses is obtained via these nongenomic effects . High glucose - induced intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 ( ICAM - 1 ) expression through an osmotic effect in rat mesangial cells is PKC - NF - kappa B - dependent . AIMS / HYPOTHESIS : Infiltration of mononuclear cells and glomerular enlargement accompanied by glomerular cell proliferation are very early characteristics of the pathophysiology of diabetes . To clarify the mechanism of early diabetic nephropathy , we measured [ 3H ] - thymidine incorporation and cell numbers to show the influence of a high ambient glucose concentration and the osmotic effect on rat mesangial cell proliferation . We also measured the effect of high glucose on the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 and vascular adhesion molecule - 1 by flow cytometry and semiquantitative RT - PCR in mesangial cells and the adhesion of leukocytes to mesangial cells . METHODS / RESULTS : Cells exposed to high D - glucose ( 30 mmol / l ) caused an increase in [ 3H ] - thymidine incorporation and cell numbers at 24 and 48 h and normalized at 72 h ( p < 0 . 05 ) , whereas these changes were not found in high mannitol ( 30 mmol / l ) , IL - 1 beta , or TNF alpha - stimulated mesangial cells . Cells exposed to high - glucose ( 15 , 30 , or 60 mmol / l ) or osmotic agents ( L - glucose , raffinose and mannitol ) showed that intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 expression began to increase after 24 h , reached its maximum at 24 and 48 h and gradually decreased afterwards . The stimulatory effects of high glucose and high mannitol on mRNA expression were observed as early as 6 h and reached its maximum at 12 h . Up - regulation of ICAM - 1 protein and mRNA was also found in IL - 1 - beta and TNF - alpha - stimulated mesangial cells . Neither vascular adhesion molecule - 1 protein nor mRNA expression was , however , affected by high glucose and high mannitol . Notably , the protein kinase C inhibitors calphostin C and staurosporine reduced high glucose - or high mannitol - induced intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 mRNA expression and high glucose - induced proliferation . Furthermore , the NF - kappa B inhibitor N - tosyl - L - phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone reduced high glucose - or high mannitol - induced intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 mRNA expression and high glucose - induced proliferation . Results showed that high glucose ( 15 , 30 mmol / l ) or high concentrations of osmotic agents remarkably increased the number of adherent leukocytes to mesangial cells ( p < 0 . 01 ) compared with control cells ( 5 mmol / l D - glucose ) . Functional blocking of intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 on mesangial cells with rat intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 monoclonal antibody , calphostin C , staurosporine , or N - tosyl - L - phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone significantly inhibited high glucose - or high mannitol - induced increase in leukocyte adhesion ( p < < 0 . 05 ) . CONCLUSION / INTERPRETATION : These results suggest that high glucose can upregulate intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 protein and mRNA expression but not vascular adhesion molecule - 1 expression in mesangial cells and promote leukocyte adhesion through up - regulation of intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 through osmotic effect , possibly depending on the protein kinase C nuclear factor - kappa B ( PKC - NF - kappa B ) pathway . High glucose itself can also promote mesangial cell proliferation through the PKC - NF - kappa B pathways . We conclude that hyperglycaemia in itself seems to be an important factor in the development of early diabetic nephropathy . Combined corticosteroid / granulocyte colony - stimulating factor ( G - CSF ) therapy in the treatment of severe congenital neutropenia unresponsive to G - CSF : Activated glucocorticoid receptors synergize with G - CSF signals . More than 90 % of patients with severe congenital neutropenia ( SCN ) respond to granulocyte colony - stimulating factor ( G - CSF ) therapy . The basis for the refractory state in the remaining patients is unknown . To address this issue , we studied a child with SCN who was totally unresponsive to G - CSF and had a novel point mutation in the extracellular domain of the G - CSF receptor ( GCSF - R ) . Marrow stromal support of granulopoiesis was evaluated by plating CD34 ( + ) cells on preformed stromal layers . Nonadherent cells were harvested and assayed in clonogenic assays for granulocytic colony production . The in vitro effect of G - CSF and corticosteroids on granulopoiesis was evaluated in clonogenic assays of marrow mononuclear cells , by proliferation studies of the murine myeloid cell line 32D expressing the patient ' s mutated G - CSFR , and by measuring STAT5 activation in nuclear extracts from stimulated cells . Patient ' s stroma supported granulopoiesis derived from control marrow CD34 ( + ) cells in a normal manner . Normal stroma , however , failed to induce granulopoiesis from patient ' s CD34 ( + ) cells . Clonogenic assays of the patient ' s marrow mononuclear cells incorporating either G - CSF or hydrocortisone produced little neutrophil growth . In contrast , inclusion of both G - CSF and hydrocortisone in the cytokine ` ` cocktail ' ' markedly increased the neutrophil numbers . Proliferation of 32D cells expressing the mutated receptor and STAT5 activation were improved by a combination of G - CSF and dexamethasone . When small daily doses of oral prednisone were then administered to the patient with conventional doses of subcutaneous G - CSF , the patient responded with increased neutrophil numbers and with a complete reversal of the infectious problems . These data provide insight into SCN unresponsive to standard G - CSF treatment and to the potential corrective action of combined treatment with G - CSF and corticosteroids through synergistic activation of STAT5 . Human renal mesangial cells are a target for the anti - inflammatory action of 9 - cis retinoic acid . Mesangial cells play an active role in the inflammatory response to glomerular injury . We have studied in cultured human mesangial cells ( CHMC ) several effects of 9 - cis retinoic acid ( 9 - cRA ) , an activator of both retinoic acid receptors ( RARs ) and retinoid X receptors ( RXRs ) . 9 - cRA inhibited foetal calf serum - induced CHMC proliferation . It also prevented CHMC death induced by the inflammatory mediator H ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) . This preventive effect was not due to any increase in H ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) catabolism and it persisted even when both catalase and glutathione synthesis were inhibited . Finally , 9 - cRA diminished monocyte adhesion to FCS - stimulated CHMC . Interestingly , the retinoid also inhibited in FCS - stimulated cells the protein expression of two mesangial adhesion molecules , fibronectin and osteopontin , but it did not modify the protein expression of intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 and vascular adhesion molecule - 1 . All major RARs and RXRs isotypes were expressed in CHMC regardless of the presence or absence of 9 - cRA . Transcripts to RAR - alpha , RAR - beta and RXR - alpha increased after incubation with 9 - cRA whereas RXR - gamma was inhibited , suggesting a major role for RARs and RXRs in 9 - cRA - anti - inflammatory effects . 9 - cRA was toxic only at 50 microM ( a concentration 50 - 5000 times higher than required for the effects above ) . Cell death occurred by apoptosis , whose onset was associated with a pronounced increase in catalase activity and reduced glutathione content , being more effectively induced by all - trans retinoic acid . Modulation of the oxidant / antioxidant balance failed to inhibit apoptosis . We conclude that mesangial cells might be a target for the treatment of inflammatory glomerulopathies with 9 - cRA . Expression of mammalian defensin genes . Antimicrobial peptides are a prevalent mechanism of host defense found throughout nature . In mammals , defensins are among the most abundant of these broad - spectrum antibiotics , and are expressed in epithelial and hematopoietic cells . The defensin peptides are especially abundant in neutrophils ; however , gene expression is limited to the promyelocyte stage . In epithelial cells , defensin genes are found as both constitutively expressed and inducible . Induction has been observed in vitro by stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide as well as inflammatory mediators . In vivo , up - regulation of several defensin genes occurs in both infectious and inflammatory states . Gene regulation occurs via signal transduction pathways common to other innate immune responses , utilizing transcription factors such as nuclear factor ( NF ) - kappaB and NF interleukin - 6 . Together , the data suggest a broad - based innate host defense whereby potent antimicrobial peptides are present to prevent initial colonization by pathogenic microorganisms . In addition , the recognition of bacteria coupled with a nascent inflammatory response can bolster this defense by a coordinated up - regulation of the peptides . Multiple signals required for cyclic AMP - responsive element binding protein ( CREB ) binding protein interaction induced by CD3 / CD28 costimulation . The optimal activation of cAMP - responsive element binding protein ( CREB ) , similar to the full activation of T lymphocytes , requires the stimulation of both CD3 and CD28 . Using a reporter system to detect interaction of CREB and CREB - binding protein ( CBP ) , in this study we found that CREB binds to CBP only by engagement of both CD3 and CD28 . CD3 / CD28 - promoted CREB - CBP interaction was dependent on p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) and calcium / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase ( CaMK ) IV in addition to the previously identified extracellular signal - regulated kinase pathway . Extracellular signal - regulated kinase , CaMKIV , and p38 MAPK were also the kinases involved in CREB Ser ( 133 ) phosphorylation induced by CD3 / CD28 . A reconstitution experiment illustrated that optimum CREB - CBP interaction and CREB trans - activation were attained when these three kinase pathways were simultaneously activated in T cells . Our results demonstrate that coordinated activation of different kinases leads to full activation of CREB . Notably , CD28 ligation activated p38 MAPK and CaMKIV , the kinases stimulated by CD3 engagement , suggesting that CD28 acts by increasing the activation extent of p38 MAPK and CaMKIV . These results support the model of a minimum activation threshold for CREB - CBP interaction that can be reached only when both CD3 and CD28 are stimulated . The murine IL - 2 promoter contains distal regulatory elements responsive to the Ah receptor , a member of the evolutionarily conserved bHLH - PAS transcription factor family . Signaling through the TCR and costimulatory signals primarily control transcription of the IL - 2 gene in naive T cells . The minimal promoter necessary for this expression lies proximal , between - 300 and the transcription start site . We had previously shown that activation of the arylhydrocarbon receptor ( AHR ) , a member of the bHLH - PAS family of transcription factors , leads to increased mRNA expression of IL - 2 in murine fetal thymocytes . The AHR is abundant in the thymus and may play a role for the development of the immune system . Moreover , its overactivation by chemicals such as dioxins leads to immunosuppression and thymic involution . Binding motifs for the liganded AHR can be identified in the distal region - 1300 to - 800 of the mouse IL - 2 promoter . We show here that these DNA motifs , the so - called dioxin response elements , after binding to the liganded AHR are sufficient to transactivate luciferase expression in a reporter gene system . The IL - 2 gene can be induced by the AHR also in thymocytes in vivo after injection of 2 , 3 , 7 , 8 - tetrachlorodibenzo - p - dioxin , a potent ligand of the AHR . The AHR mediates the IL - 2 induction as shown with AHR - deficient mice . However , in spleen cells in vitro costimulation via the TCR is necessary for optimal IL - 2 gene induction . Thus , the IL - 2 promoter region contains novel distal regulatory elements that can be addressed by the AHR to induce IL - 2 and can cooperate with the proximal promoter Visualization of Syk - antigen receptor interactions using green fluorescent protein : differential roles for Syk and Lyn in the regulation of receptor capping and internalization . The cross - linking of the B cell Ag receptor ( BCR ) is coupled to the stimulation of multiple intracellular signal transduction cascades via receptor - associated , protein tyrosine kinases of both the Src and Syk families . To monitor changes in the subcellular distribution of Syk in B cells responding to BCR cross - linking , we expressed in Syk - deficient DT40 B cells a fusion protein consisting of Syk coupled to green fluorescent protein . Treatment of these cells with anti - IgM Abs leads to the recruitment of the kinase from cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments to the site of the cross - linked receptor at the plasma membrane . The Syk - receptor complexes aggregate into membrane patches that redistribute to form a cap at one pole of the cell . Syk is not demonstrably associated with the internalized receptor . Catalytically active Syk promotes and stabilizes the formation of tightly capped BCR complexes at the plasma membrane . Lyn is not required for the recruitment of Syk to the cross - linked receptor , but is required for the internalization of the clustered BCR complexes . In the absence of Lyn , receptor - Syk complexes at the plasma membrane are long lived , and the receptor - mediated activation of the NF - AT transcription factor is enhanced . Thus , Lyn appears to function to negatively regulate aspects of BCR - dependent signaling by stimulating receptor internalization and down - regulation . Renal interstitial fibrosis is reduced in angiotensin II type 1a receptor - deficient mice . Unilateral ureteral obstruction ( UUO ) results in tubulointerstitial fibrosis of the affected kidney by stimulating the renin - angiotensin system . This study established a UUO model in angiotensin type 1a receptor ( AT1a ) deficient ( mutant ) mice to elucidate the role of angiotensin II through AT1a on the fibrosis of the obstructed kidney ( OBK ) . The relative volume of the tubulointerstitium was measured by an image analyzer ; deposition of collagen types III and IV and monocyte / macrophage infiltration were histologically examined using specific antibodies . Also determined were the mRNA levels of transforming growth factor - beta by Northern blot analysis . Nuclear factor - kappaB activity was assessed by gel shift assay . UUO in wild mice resulted in a marked expansion of relative volume of the tubulointerstitium , together with increased deposition of collagen types III and IV and number of infiltrated monocytes / macrophages in the interstitium , relative to sham - operated mice . In comparison , these changes were significantly lower in mutant mice with UUO . The mRNA level of transforming growth factor - beta was significantly higher in the OBK of wild mice with UUO compared with sham - operated mice . In contrast , the increase in mRNA level in the OBK of mutant mice was significantly less than in wild mice . Finally , UUO resulted in activation of nuclear factor - kappaB in wild mice but was inhibited in the OBK of mutant mice . The results provide direct evidence that angiotensin II acting via the AT1a plays a pivotal role in the development of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in UUO . HLA - DQ tetramers identify epitope - specific T cells in peripheral blood of herpes simplex virus type 2 - infected individuals : direct detection of immunodominant antigen - responsive cells . Ag - specific CD4 + T cells are present in peripheral blood in low frequency , where they undergo recruitment and expansion during immune responses and in the pathogenesis of numerous autoimmune diseases . MHC tetramers , which constitute a labeled MHC - peptide ligand suitable for binding to the Ag - specific receptor on T cells , provide a novel approach for the detection and characterization of such rare cells . In this study , we utilized this technology to identify HLA DQ - restricted Ag - specific T cells in the peripheral blood of human subjects and to identify immunodominant epitopes associated with viral infection . Peptides representing potential epitope regions of the VP16 protein from HSV - 2 were loaded onto recombinant DQ0602 molecules to generate a panel of Ag - specific DQ0602 tetramers . VP16 Ag - specific DQ - restricted T cells were identified and expanded from the peripheral blood of HSV - 2 - infected individuals , representing two predominant epitope specificities . Although the VP16 369 - 380 peptide has a lower binding affinity for DQ0602 molecules than the VP16 33 - 52 peptide , T cells that recognized the VP16 369 - 380 peptide occurred at a much higher frequency than those that were specific for the VP16 33 - 52 peptide . Down - regulation of BOB . 1 / OBF . 1 and Oct2 in classical Hodgkin disease but not in lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin disease correlates with immunoglobulin transcription . In contrast to the tumor cells ( L & H cells ) of lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin disease ( LPHD ) , Hodgkin and Reed - Sternberg ( HRS ) cells of classical Hodgkin disease ( cHD ) are unable to transcribe immunoglobulin , despite the presence of rearranged immunoglobulin genes . Although initial studies have suggested crippling immunoglobulin gene mutations to be the cause of absent immunoglobulin expression in cHD , recent work of our group has demonstrated an impaired activation of the immunoglobulin promoter as a superior mechanism . As immunoglobulin transcription is mainly regulated by the B - cell transcription factors Oct2 and BOB . 1 / OBF . 1 , we analyzed 35 cases of LPHD , 32 cases of cHD , and 2 Hodgkin disease cell lines for the expression of these transcription factors and also in parallel for immunoglobulin expression . Our results demonstrate an absence of Oct2 and / or BOB . 1 / OBF . 1 in cHD and a striking overexpression of Oct2 in LPHD . Immunoglobulin expression was lacking in cHD but present in LPHD . Furthermore , the reintroduction of BOB . 1 / OBF . 1 and Oct2 into cultured HRS cells restored the activity of cotransduced immunoglobulin promoter constructs . Our findings dismiss the concept that the different immunoglobulin expression in cHD and LPHD is due to disrupting mutations of immunoglobulin V genes in cHD but is most likely due to a down - regulation of Oct2 and / or BOB . 1 / OBF . 1 . This study further revealed Oct2 as a new and valuable marker for the identification of L & H cells and their distinction from HRS cells . The impairment of immunoglobulin transcription with a down - regulated synthesis of Oct2 and BOB . 1 / OBF . 1 is the first established general recurrent defect found in HRS cells . Constitutive expression of NF - kappa B is a characteristic feature of mycosis fungoides : implications for apoptosis resistance and pathogenesis . The NF - kappa B family of transcription factors is an important regulator of genes expressed during inflammatory responses , immunoglobulin ( Ig ) class switching , cellular differentiation , and apoptosis . Recently , members of the NF - kappaB family , including p65 ( Rel A ) , have been implicated in promoting survival of various hematopoeitic neoplasms , including T cell malignancies such as adult T cell leukemia - lymphoma . We investigated the expression of active NF - kappa B p65 ( Rel A ) in cases of mycosis fungoides ( MF ) and the effect of chemical inhibitors of NF - kappa B on apoptosis in cutaneous T cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) cell lines . Paraffin - embedded tissues from 23 cutaneous lesions and a single lymph node biopsy from patients diagnosed with MF were evaluated for p65 ( Rel A ) expression by using a monoclonal mouse antibody that detects the activated form of p65 ( Rel A ) . Apoptosis after treatment with the NF - kappa B inhibitors gliotoxin , MG132 , BAY 11 - 7082 , and BAY 11 - 7085 was quantitatively measured in the CTCL cell lines HuT - 78 and HH by propidium iodide ( PI ) / cell cycle analysis for detection of a hypodiploid ( sub - G ( 0 ) ) population and by determination of increased Annexin V / 7 - amino - actinomycin D ( 7 - AAD ) expression . Nuclear extracts from CTCL cells before and after chemical inhibition were analyzed for NF - kappa B nuclear DNA - binding activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) with quantitative densitometry . Nuclear expression of p65 ( Rel A ) before and after treatment with the various inhibitory compounds was measured by immunofluorescence staining in each CTCL cell line . Neoplastic T lymphocytes from 22 of 24 cases of MF showed strong nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of active p65 ( Rel A ) . Compared with untreated control cells , a marked increase in apoptosis , a significant decrease in NF - kappa B DNA - binding activity , and a marked decrease in nuclear p65 ( Rel A ) expression were seen in cells from both CTCL cell lines after chemical NF - kappa B inhibition . These data show that the active form of NF - kappa B p65 ( Rel A ) is commonly expressed in neoplastic T lymphocytes in patients with MF . In CTCL cell lines , the significant decrease in nuclear NF - kappa B expression and the marked increase in spontaneous apoptosis caused by chemical NF - kappa B inhibition suggest a critical role for NF - kappa B in the pathogenesis and tumor cell maintenance of CTCLs . HUM PATHOL 31 : 1482 - 1490 . Human T - cell leukemia virus type 1 tax protein activates transcription through AP - 1 site by inducing DNA binding activity in T cells . Human T - cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV - 1 ) Tax protein induces the expression of various family members of the transcription factor AP - 1 , such as c - Jun , JunD , c - Fos , and Fra - 1 , at the level of RNA expression in T cells . We examined the activity of Tax in transcription through AP - 1 - binding sites ( AP - 1 site ) in T cells . Transient transfection studies showed that Tax activated the expression of a luciferase gene regulated by two copies of an AP - 1 site in the human Jurkat T - cell line . Tax activates the expression of viral and cellular genes through two different enhancers : a cAMP - responsive ( CRE ) - like element and a kappaB element . Two Tax mutants differentially activated expression of these two elements . Tax703 preferentially activated the kappaB element but not the CRE - like one , whereas TaxM22 showed the reverse . In addition , Tax703 and Tax , but not TaxM22 , converted cell growth of a mouse T - cell line from being interleukin ( IL ) - 2 - dependent to being IL - 2 - independent . Unlike the wild - type Tax , Tax703 and TaxM22 only weakly activated the AP - 1 site in the T - cell line . Thus , Tax seems to activate the AP - 1 site via mechanisms distinct from those of kappaB or CRE - like elements , and the activation of the AP - 1 site is dispensable for IL - 2 - independent growth of CTLL - 2 . Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that Tax induced strong binding activity to an AP - 1 site in CTLL - 2 , whereas Tax703 did not , indicating that the induction of binding activity to the AP - 1 site is essential for the transcriptional activation by Tax . The binding complex induced by Tax in CTLL - 2 contained JunD and Fra - 2 . Other AP - 1 proteins were undetectable . Activation of transcription through the AP - 1 site in Jurkat cells by JunD and / or Fra - 2 was weak . c - Jun , JunB , and c - Fos activation was greater , although the level was still less than that with Tax . Thus , the induction of AP - 1 mRNA by Tax may not be sufficient for a complete activation of AP - 1 site by Tax . Our results suggest that Tax activates the transcription of cellular genes with AP - 1 sites by inducing the DNA - binding activity of AP - 1 proteins in T cells , a mechanism distinct from those of CRE - like and kappaB elements .

Live - attenuated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) variants have shown great promise as AIDS vaccines , but continued replication can lead to the selection of faster - replicating variants that are pathogenic . We therefore designed HIV - 1 genomes that replicate exclusively upon addition of the nontoxic effector doxycycline ( dox ) . This was achieved by replacement of the viral TAR - Tat system for transcriptional activation by the Escherichia coli - derived Tet system for inducible gene expression . These designer ` ` HIV - rtTA ' ' viruses replicate in a strictly dox - dependent manner both in a T - cell line and in primary blood cells , and the rate of replication can be fine - tuned by simple variation of the dox concentration . These HIV - rtTA viruses provide a tool to perform genetics , e . g . , selection and optimization experiments , with the E . coli - derived Tet reagents in a eukaryotic background . Furthermore , such viruses may represent improved vaccine candidates because their replication can be turned on and off at will . Synovial fluid induced nuclear factor - kappaB DNA binding in a monocytic cell line . OBJECTIVE : To determine the effects of synovial fluids ( SF ) on DNA binding activity of transcription factor nuclear factor - kappaB ( NF - kappaB ) in the Mono Mac 6 monocytic / macrophage cell line as a model for the interaction between SF and synovial tissue macrophages in arthritis . METHODS : Mono Mac 6 cells were incubated with SF from the knee joints of human subjects with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , undifferentiated seronegative oligoarthritis , and osteoarthritis ( OA ) . Nuclear extracts prepared from the Mono Mac 6 cells and RA synovial tissue were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis ( EMSA ) for NF - kappaB DNA binding proteins . RESULTS : Induction of NF - kappaB DNA binding by the p65 ( RelA ) / p50 heterodimer was observed in response to incubation of Mono Mac 6 cells with SF ( 20 % in culture medium ) from 5 of 8 subjects with RA , 4 of 5 with OA , and none of 3 with undifferentiated seronegative oligoarthritis . Incubation of SF with neutralizing antibodies against tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF - alpha ) , but not antibodies against interleukin 6 ( IL - 6 ) , significantly reduced the induction of p65 / p50 binding activity in SF from subjects with RA and OA . Unexpectedly , a slowly migrating SF inducible NF - kappaB - binding complex was observed in EMSA of Mono Mac 6 cells after incubation with SF from 5 of 8 RA and 2 of 5 OA subjects . The induction of this complex by SF was not affected by neutralization of TNF - alpha or IL - 6 in SF , and the complex was not inducible by TNF - alpha , IL - 1beta , TNF - alpha / IL - 1beta , IL - 6 , platelet derived growth factor , lipopolysaccharide , or tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate . The slowly migrating complex could not be supershifted with antibodies against NF - kappaB , Jun , or the transcriptional coactivators p300 or CBP . A NF - kappaB - binding complex with similar slow mobility was observed in nuclear extracts prepared from fresh human RA synovial tissue . CONCLUSION : Biological activity of TNF - alpha in SF from RA and OA subjects is capable of inducing p65 / p50 NF - kappaB DNA binding activity in macrophages . A property of SF that is independent of TNF - alpha and other cytokines is responsible for the induction of a novel slowly migrating NF - kappaB - binding complex . Soluble mediators in SF of subjects with RA and OA can therefore modulate binding of nuclear proteins to the NF - kappaB binding site in macrophages and may play a role in inflammatory gene expression in arthritis . Peroxisome proliferator activator receptor - gamma agonists and 15 - deoxy - Delta ( 12 , 14 ) ( 12 , 14 ) - PGJ ( 2 ) induce apoptosis in normal and malignant B - lineage cells . The research described herein evaluates the expression and functional significance of peroxisome proliferator activator receptor - gamma ( PPAR - gamma ) on B - lineage cells . Normal mouse B cells and a variety of B lymphoma cells reflective of stages of B cell differentiation ( e . g . , 70Z / 3 , CH31 , WEHI - 231 , CH12 , and J558 ) express PPAR - gamma mRNA and , by Western blot analysis , the 67 - kDa PPAR - gamma protein . 15 - Deoxy - Delta ( 12 , 14 ) - PGJ ( 2 ) ( 15d - PGJ ( 2 ) ) , a PPAR - gamma agonist , has a dose - dependent antiproliferative and cytotoxic effect on normal and malignant B cells as shown by [ ( 3 ) H ] thymidine and 3 - [ 4 , 5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ] - 2 , 5 - diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays . Only PPAR - gamma agonists ( thiazolidinediones ) , and not PPAR - alpha agonists , mimicked the effect of 15d - PGJ ( 2 ) on B - lineage cells , indicating that the mechanism by which 15d - PGJ ( 2 ) negatively affects B - lineage cells involves in part PPAR - gamma . The mechanism by which PPAR - gamma agonists induce cytotoxicity is via apoptosis , as shown by annexin V staining and as confirmed by DNA fragmentation detected using the TUNEL assay . Interestingly , addition of PGF ( 2alpha ) , which was not known to affect lymphocytes , dramatically attenuated the deleterious effects of PPAR - gamma agonists on B lymphomas . Surprisingly , 15d - PGJ ( 2 ) induced a massive increase in nuclear mitogen - activated protein kinase activation , and pretreatment with PGF ( 2alpha ) blunted the mitogen - activated protein kinase activation . This is the first study evaluating PPAR - gamma expression and its significance on B lymphocytes . PPAR - gamma agonists may serve as a counterbalance to the stimulating effects of other PGs , namely PGE ( 2 ) , which promotes B cell differentiation . Finally , the use of PGs , such as 15d - PGJ ( 2 ) , and synthetic PPAR - gamma agonists to induce apoptosis in B - lineage cells may lead to the development of novel therapies for fatal B lymphomas Inhibition of STAT3 signaling leads to apoptosis of leukemic large granular lymphocytes and decreased Mcl - 1 expression . Large granular lymphocyte ( LGL ) leukemia is characterized by the expansion of antigen - activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes . These leukemic cells are resistant to Fas - mediated apoptosis despite expressing high levels of Fas . We found that leukemic LGL from 19 patients displayed high levels of activated STAT3 . Treatment of leukemic LGL with the JAK - selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG - 490 induced apoptosis with a corresponding decrease in STAT - DNA binding activity . Moreover , using an antisense oligonucleotide approach to diminish STAT3 expression , we found that Fas sensitivity was restored in leukemic LGL . AG - 490 - induced apoptosis in leukemic LGL was independent of Bcl - xL or Bcl - 2 expression . However , we found that the Bcl - 2 - family protein Mcl - 1 was significantly reduced by AG - 490 treatment . Activated STAT3 was shown to bind an SIE - related element in the murine mcl - 1 promoter . Using a luciferase reporter assay , we demonstrated that v - src overexpression in NIH3T3 induced STAT3 - dependent transcriptional activity from the mcl - 1 promoter and increased endogenous Mcl - 1 protein levels . We conclude that STAT3 activation contributed to accumulation of the leukemic LGL clones . These findings suggest that investigation should focus on novel strategies targeting STAT3 in the treatment of LGL leukemia . Decreased immediate inflammatory gene induction in activating transcription factor - 2 mutant mice . Transcription factor activating transcription factor ( ATF ) - 2 is activated by inflammatory signals transduced by the JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways . To better define the role of ATF - 2 in inflammation , adult mice expressing small amounts of a mutant ATF - 2 protein were challenged with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , anti - CD3 antibody or virus . Within 3 h of challenge by LPS , ATF - 2 mutant mice had decreased induction of the adhesion molecules E - selectin , P - selectin and VCAM - 1 as well as the cytokines tumor necrosis factor - alpha , IL - 1beta and IL - 6 compared with control mice . Stimulation of T lymphocytes by anti - CD3 antibody also showed less induction of IL - 1 and IL - 6 in ATF - 2 mutant tissues . ATF - 2 mutant thymocytes treated with anti - CD3 antibody in vitro demonstrated reduced induction of c - Jun , JunB , JunD and Fra - 2 . However , similar to what was observed after p38 kinase inhibition in normal mice , relative ATF - 2 deficiency did not prevent the development of a mononuclear cell infiltrate in the week following an inflammatory stimulus . ATF - 2 mutant mice proved more susceptible to death than control mice from LPS plus D - galactosamine injection or Coxsackievirus B3 infection and had a higher incidence of mononuclear pulmonary infiltrates after exposure to Herpes simplex virus - 1 . ATF - 2 is essential for maximal immediate induction of adhesion molecules and cytokine genes , but at later time points may even protect against overactive immune responses . LIGHT , a TNF - like molecule , costimulates T cell proliferation and is required for dendritic cell - mediated allogeneic T cell response . LIGHT is a recently identified member of the TNF superfamily and its receptors , herpesvirus entry mediator and lymphotoxin beta receptor , are found in T cells and stromal cells . In this study , we demonstrate that LIGHT is selectively expressed on immature dendritic cells ( DCs ) generated from human PBMCs . In contrast , LIGHT is not detectable in DCs either freshly isolated from PBMCs or rendered mature in vitro by LPS treatment . Blockade of LIGHT by its soluble receptors , lymphotoxin beta receptor - Ig or HVEM - Ig , inhibits the induction of DC - mediated primary allogeneic T cell response . Furthermore , engagement of LIGHT costimulates human T cell proliferation , amplifies the NF - kappaB signaling pathway , and preferentially induces the production of IFN - gamma , but not IL - 4 , in the presence of an antigenic signal . Our results suggest that LIGHT is a costimulatory molecule involved in DC - mediated cellular immune responses . Suppression of HIV type 1 replication by a dominant - negative Ets - 1 mutant . Activity of the distal region of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV - 1 ) long terminal repeat ( LTR ) , which contains binding sites for the Ets - 1 and USF - 1 proteins , is integral for HIV - 1 replication . The Ets - 1 and USF - 1 proteins play a critical role in the activity of the HIV - 1 LTR distal enhancer region , as indicated by the potent dominant negative effect of a mutant Ets - 1 lacking trans - activation domains on the transcriptional activity of the LTR . To determine the biological relevance of the Ets - 1 and USF - 1 proteins in HIV - 1 replication , we examined the effect of expression of the dominant - negative mutant of Ets - 1 ( dnEts - 1 ) on HIV - 1 infection of T cells . We demonstrated that expression of dnEts markedly suppressed HIV - 1 infection of a T cell line . This finding indicates that formation of a transcriptionaly active USF - 1 / Ets - 1 complex is important in the productive infection of cells by HIV - 1 , and suggests that inhibition of the interaction between USF - 1 and Ets - 1 with the HIV - 1 LTR may provide a new target for anti - HIV - 1 gene therapy . Human eosinophils constitutively express nuclear factor of activated T cells p and c . BACKGROUND : Eosinophils are now known to produce a variety of proinflammatory cytokines , although the molecular factors that regulate their production are poorly understood . The expression of almost all of the cytokines produced by eosinophils , including the proallergic cytokine IL - 4 , is now known to be regulated at the level of transcription by members of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) family of transcription factors . OBJECTIVE : We sought to characterize the expression of different NFAT proteins in resting and activated eosinophils . METHODS : Nuclear and whole cell extracts were obtained from both peripheral blood eosinophils and those obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of asthmatic subjects after endobronchial allergen challenge . NFAT expression was determined by using immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis , DNA - binding assays , and RT - PCR analysis of eosinophil mRNA . RESULTS : Both peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid eosinophils expressed NFATp and NFATc protein . Unlike activated T cells , which express multiple NFATc isoforms , eosinophils preferentially express the approximately 85 - kd isoform . In addition , eosinophils were found to constitutively express NFATc mRNA . A brief incubation with the T ( H ) 2 cytokines IL - 4 and IL - 5 was sufficient to induce the nuclear translocation of NFATc . Eosinophil nuclear extracts contain multiple factors that can specifically recognize the IL - 4 promoter P1 NFAT site in DNA - binding assays , including NFATp . CONCLUSION : NFATp and NFATc can regulate the expression of cytokines and other genes in eosinophils but appear to be regulated by a novel signal transduction mechanism in these cells . BLyS BINDS TO B CELLS WITH HIGH AFFINITY AND INDUCES ACTIVATION OF THE TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS NF - kappaB AND ELF - 1 . B lymphocyte stimulator ( BLyS ) is a novel member of the TNF family of proteins expressed by myeloid cells as membrane - bound and soluble forms . BLyS was shown to act specifically on B cells , inducing proliferation and immunoglobulin production both in vitro and in vivo . The present study was undertaken to characterize binding of radiolabeled BLyS to its cognate receptor on human B lymphocytes and examine intracellular events initiated by BLyS binding . Similar to other TNF family members , BLyS is present in solution as a homotrimer as determined by gel filtration chromatography and light scattering analysis . BLyS binding to B cells is specific as other TNF family members tested did not compete for ( 125 ) I - BLyS binding . Analysis of equilibrium binding of ( 125 ) I - labeled BLyS to purified human tonsillar B cells demonstrated saturable binding . Scatchard analysis of the binding data revealed a single class of high - affinity binding on human B cells with approximately 2600 binding sites per cell and an apparent dissociation constant ( K ( D ) ) of about 0 . 1 nM . In addition we report that BLyS binding to B cells results in the activation of NF - kappaB and the Ets family transcription factor , ELF - 1 , and in the induction of mRNA for Polo - like kinase ( PLK ) .

The Nef protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) has been shown to enhance the infectivity of virus particles , downmodulate cell surface proteins , and associate with many intracellular proteins that are thought to facilitate HIV infection . One of the challenges in defining the molecular events regulated by Nef has been obtaining good expression of Nef protein in T cells . This has been attributed to effects of Nef on cell proliferation and apoptosis . We have designed a Nef protein that is readily expressed in T - cell lines and whose function is inducibly activated . It is composed of a fusion between full - length Nef and the estrogen receptor hormone - binding domain ( Nef - ER ) . The Nef - ER is kept in an inactive state due to steric hindrance , and addition of the membrane - permeable drug 4 - hydroxytamoxifen ( 4 - HT ) , which binds to the ER domain , leads to inducible activation of Nef - ER within cells . We demonstrate that Nef - ER inducibly associates with the 62 - kDa Ser / Thr kinase and is localized to specific membrane microdomains ( lipid rafts ) only after activation . Using this inducible Nef , we also compared the specific requirements for CD4 and HLA - A2 downmodulation in a SupT1 T - cell line . Half - maximal downmodulation of cell surface CD4 required very little active Nef - ER and occurred as early as 4 h after addition of 4 - HT . In contrast , 50 % downmodulation of HLA - A2 by Nef required 16 to 24 h and about 50 - to 100 - fold - greater concentrations of 4 - HT . These data suggest that HLA - A2 downmodulation may require certain threshold levels of active Nef . The differential timing of CD4 and HLA - A2 downmodulation may have implications for HIV pathogenesis and immune evasion . Regulation of chemokine mRNA expression in a rat model of vanadium - induced pulmonary inflammation . Environmental and occupational exposure to vanadium dusts results in toxic effects mainly confined to the respiratory system . Using a rat model of acute lung inflammation induced by intratracheal instillation of sodium metavanadate ( NaVO3 ) at the dose of 200 microg V / kg , we investigated the relationship between the cytologic characterization of pulmonary inflammation and the expression of chemokine mRNA . Significant polymorphonuclear leukocyte ( PMN ) influx ( P < 0 . 01 ) into the lung was noted 4 h after NaVO3 instillation , whereas alveolar macrophages ( AMs ) in bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) cells appeared to decrease significantly . In contrast , neither PMNs nor AMs changed substantially 1 h after NaVO3 instillation . By Northern analysis , macrophage inflammatory protein ( MIP ) - 2 mRNA in BAL cells increased markedly 1 h after NaVO3 instillation and reduced a little bit at 4 h , whereas MIP - 1alpha mRNA in BAL cells was expressed relatively high 1 h after NaVO3 instillation , although a basal expression was detected in control group , and returned rapidly nearly to control level at 4 h . Since MIP - 2 is a potent PMN chemoattractant and MIP - 1alpha is a potent macrophage / monocyte chemoattractant has been well known . The facts that PMN influx was preceded by increased MIP - 2 mRNA expression , suggesting that MIP - 2 is involved in the development of NaVO3 - induced pulmonary inflammation , whereas increased MIP - 1alpha mRNA expression was followed by decreased AMs in BAL cells , suggesting AMs might be activated by MIP - 1alpha , adherent to the lining surface of the airways and then resistant to be washed out . To delineate the mechanisms of transcriptional activation , we recently cloned the 5 ' - flanking region of the MIP - 2 gene . The promotor region contains consensus binding sites for transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB ( NF - kappaB ) and activator protein - 1 ( AP - 1 ) . Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay , increased nuclear NF - kappaB , not AP - 1 , binding activity was detected 1 h after NaVO3 instillation , which correlated with the induction of MIP - 2 mRNA . p65 ( Rel A ) and p50 protein appears to be involved in MIP - 2 NF - kappaB binding . Taken together , our studies suggest that MIP - 2 is an important mediator of NaVO3 - induced pulmonary inflammation in the rat model . In addition , elevated MIP - 2 mRNA levels are accompanied by increased NF - kappaB binding activity in BAL cells , suggesting possible MIP - 2 transcriptional regulation through NF - kappaB . Activation of signal transduction and apoptosis in healthy lymphomonocytes exposed to bystander HIV - 1 - infected cells . Persistent activation of the immune system is one of the hallmarks of HIV - 1 infection . In this study we analysed the induction of factors involved in cytokine signal transduction , such as STAT 1 proteins and IRF - 1 mRNA , in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) exposed to HIV - infected cells , and the induction of apoptosis . Western blot analyses and reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction results indicate that both cells infected with a X4 strain and cells infected with a R5 strain are able to increase intracellular levels of STAT 1alpha and beta proteins as well as IRF - 1 mRNA . This effect was prevented by neutralizing antibodies against interferon - alpha ( IFN - alpha ) . HIV - 1 - infected cells dose - dependently induced apoptotic commitment in normal PBMC , as revealed by DNA fragmentation analysis , but this was not accompanied by an increase of caspase - 3 activity , even if a slight up - regulation of IL - 1beta - converting enzyme mRNA was detected . Apoptosis induction could be abrogated mainly by antibodies against tumour necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF - alpha ) and , to a lesser extent , by antibodies against IFN - gamma . All these findings suggest that uninfected PBMC can undergo activation of signal transduction and apoptosis after exposure to bystander HIV - infected cells , subsequent to the induction of cytokines such as IFNs and TNF - alpha . The physical association of protein kinase C theta with a lipid raft - associated inhibitor of kappa B factor kinase ( IKK ) complex plays a role in the activation of the NF - kappa B cascade by TCR and CD28 . We investigated the role of protein kinase C theta ( PKCtheta ) in the activation of the NF - kappaB cascade in primary human CD4 ( + ) lymphocytes . Among six or so PKC isoforms expressed in T cells , only PKCtheta participates in the assembly of the supramolecular activation clusters at the contact site of the TCR with Ag . Signaling via both the TCR and CD28 is required for optimal activation of the multisubunit IkappaB kinase ( IKK ) complex in primary human T lymphocytes ; this activation could be inhibited by a Ca ( 2 + ) - independent PKC isoform inhibitor , rottlerin . Moreover , endogenous PKCtheta physically associates with activated IKK complexes in CD3 / CD28 - costimulated primary CD4 ( + ) T cells . The same set of stimuli also induced relocation of endogenous PKCtheta and IKKs to a GM1 ganglioside - enriched , detergent - insoluble membrane compartment in primary T cells . IKKs recruited to these lipid rafts were capable of phosphorylating a recombinant IkappaBalpha sustrate . Confocal microscopy further demonstrated that exogenously expressed PKCtheta and IKKss colocalize in the membrane of CD3 / CD28 - costimulated Jurkat T cells . Constitutively active but not kinase - inactive PKCtheta activated IKKbeta in Jurkat T cells . Expression of dominant - active PKCtheta also had stimulatory effects on the CD28 response element of the IL - 2 promoter . Taken together , these data show that the activation of PKCtheta by the TCR and CD28 plays an important role in the assembly and activation of IKK complexes in the T cell membrane T - cell - mediated regulation of osteoclastogenesis by signalling cross - talk between RANKL and IFN - gamma . Bone resorption is regulated by the immune system , where T - cell expression of RANKL ( receptor activator of nuclear factor ( NF ) - kappaB ligand ) , a member of the tumour - necrosis factor family that is essential for osteoclastogenesis , may contribute to pathological conditions , such as autoimmune arthritis . However , whether activated T cells maintain bone homeostasis by counterbalancing the action of RANKL remains unknown . Here we show that T - cell production of interferon ( IFN ) - gamma strongly suppresses osteoclastogenesis by interfering with the RANKL - RANK signalling pathway . IFN - gamma induces rapid degradation of the RANK adapter protein , TRAF6 ( tumour necrosis factor receptor - associated factor 6 ) , which results in strong inhibition of the RANKL - induced activation of the transcription factor NF - kappaB and JNK . This inhibition of osteoclastogenesis is rescued by overexpressing TRAF6 in precursor cells , which indicates that TRAF6 is the target critical for the IFN - gamma action . Furthermore , we provide evidence that the accelerated degradation of TRAF6 requires both its ubiquitination , which is initiated by RANKL , and IFN - gamma - induced activation of the ubiquitin - proteasome system . Our study shows that there is cross - talk between the tumour necrosis factor and IFN families of cytokines , through which IFN - gamma provides a negative link between T - cell activation and bone resorption . Our results may offer a therapeutic approach to treat the inflammation - induced tissue breakdown . Stromal - derived factor 1 and thrombopoietin regulate distinct aspects of human megakaryopoiesis . The role of the chemokine binding stromal - derived factor 1 ( SDF - 1 ) in normal human megakaryopoiesis at the cellular and molecular levels and its comparison with that of thrombopoietin ( TPO ) have not been determined . In this study it was found that SDF - 1 , unlike TPO , does not stimulate alpha ( IIb ) beta ( 3 ) ( + ) cell proliferation or differentiation or have an antiapoptotic effect . However , it does induce chemotaxis , trans - Matrigel migration , and secretion of matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP - 9 ) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) by these cells , and both SDF - 1 and TPO increase the adhesion of alpha ( IIb ) beta ( 3 ) ( + ) cells to fibrinogen and vitronectin . Investigating the intracellular signaling pathways induced by SDF - 1 and TPO revealed some overlapping patterns of protein phosphorylation / activation ( mitogen - activated protein kinase [ MAPK ] p42 / 44 , MAPK p38 , and AKT [ protein kinase B ] ) and some that were distinct for TPO ( eg , JAK - STAT ) and for SDF - 1 ( eg , NF - kappa B ) . It was also found that though inhibition of phosphatidyl - inositol 3 - kinase ( PI - 3K ) by LY294002 in alpha ( IIb ) beta ( 3 ) ( + ) cells induced apoptosis and inhibited chemotaxis adhesion and the secretion of MMP - 9 and VEGF , the inhibition of MAPK p42 / 44 ( by the MEK inhibitor U0126 ) had no effect on the survival , proliferation , and migration of these cells . Hence , it is suggested that the proliferative effect of TPO is more related to activation of the JAK - STAT pathway ( unique to TPO ) , and the PI - 3K - AKT axis is differentially involved in TPO - and SDF - 1 - dependent signaling . Accordingly , PI - 3K is involved in TPO - mediated inhibition of apoptosis , TPO - and SDF - 1 - regulated adhesion to fibrinogen and vitronectin , and SDF - 1 - mediated migration . This study expands the understanding of the role of SDF - 1 and TPO in normal human megakaryopoiesis and indicates the molecular basis of the observed differences in cellular responses . ( Blood . 2000 ; 96 : 4142 - 4151 ) Adhesion of immature and mature T cells induces in human thymic epithelial cells ( TEC ) activation of IL - 6 gene trascription factors ( NF - kappaB and NF - IL6 ) and IL - 6 gene expression : role of alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta4 integrins . T cell precursors homed to thymus develop in close contact with stromal cells . Among them , thymic epithelial cells ( TEC ) are known to exert dominant roles in their survival and functional shaping . Key molecules mediating TEC / thymocytes interactions include cytokines and growth factors secreted by the two cell types and adhesion receptors mediating cell contact . Signaling events triggered in thymocytes by adhesion to epithelial cells have been extensively investigated , whereas little is known on the opposite phenomenon . We have previously investigated this issue in a co - culture system composed of TEC cultures derived from human normal thymus and heterologous thymocytes . We demonstrated that thymocytes adhere to TEC involving beta1 and beta4 integrins and induce the clustering of alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta4 heterodimers at the TEC surface . In addition thymocyte adhesion was followed by activation of NF - kappaB and NF - IL6 gene transcription factors and enhanced IL - 6 production . The two latter phenomena were reproduced by the cross - linking of the alpha3 , alpha6 , beta1 and beta4 integrins , thus implying that the alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta4 heterodimers can signal during thymocyte adhesion . We have extended our previous work investigating in the same experimental setting the inducing activity of non stimulated or activated policlonal or clonal mature T cells as representative of the more mature thymocyte subset . We found that adhesion of unstimulated T cell i ) involved beta1 , but not beta4 integrin functions at the surface ii ) induced the clustering of alpha3beta1 , but not alpha2beta1 heterodimers at the TEC surface and iii ) up - regulated the nuclear binding activity of NF - kappaB transcription factor and the IL - 6 secretion . We propose that alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta4 heterodimers are induced to cluster at the TEC surface recognizing yet unknown cellular ligands differentially expressed during T cell development . Identification and characterization of SKAT - 2 , a novel Th2 - specific zinc finger gene . We have identified a novel Kruppel - type zinc finger ( ZF ) gene , SKAT - 2 , which is selectively expressed by murine Th2 cells . The protein encoded by this gene has 14 C2H2 - type ZF tandemly arrayed at its C terminus and N - terminal SCAN box and KRAB domains . SKAT - 2 is tissue restricted in expression at the RNA level , detectable only in brain and at low levels in kidney and spleen and few hematopoietic cell lines . By in situ hybridization , SKAT - 2 expression was found to peak in antigen - stimulated CD4 ( + ) T cells after 2 - 3 days of culture under Th2 but not Th1 biasing conditions . This pattern of expression closely mirrored that of GATA - 3 in the same cells . In transient transfection experiments in phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate / ionomycin - stimulated EL4 cells , SKAT - 2 was found to up - regulate the activity of the IL - 4 but not the IL - 5 promoter , contrasting with the ability of GATA - 3 to activate both promoters . This result was confirmed using clones of EL4 cells stably expressing an inducible form of SKAT - 2 , thus SKAT - 2 is a novel Th2 - specific gene that may play a role in selective regulation of cytokine genes in T cells . hsp70 interacting protein Hip does not affect glucocorticoid receptor folding by the hsp90 - based chaperone machinery except to oppose the effect of BAG - 1 . Reticulocyte lysate contains a chaperone system that assembles glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) . hsp90 heterocomplexes . Using purified proteins , we have prepared a five - protein heterocomplex assembly system consisting of two proteins essential for heterocomplex assembly - hsp90 and hsp70 - and three proteins that act as co - chaperones to enhance assembly - Hop , hsp40 , p23 [ Morishima , Y . , Kanelakis , K . C . , Silverstein , A . M . , Dittmar , K . D . , Estrada , L . , and Pratt , W . B . ( 2000 ) J . Biol . Chem . 275 , 6894 - 6900 ] . The hsp70 co - chaperone Hip has been recovered in receptor . hsp90 heterocomplexes at an intermediate stage of assembly in reticulocyte lysate , and Hip is also thought to be an intrinsic component of the assembly machinery . Here we show that immunodepletion of Hip from reticulocyte lysate or addition of high levels of Hip to the purified five - protein system does not affect GR . hsp90 heterocomplex assembly or the activation of steroid binding activity that occurs with assembly . Despite the fact that Hip does not affect assembly , it is recovered in GR . hsp90 heterocomplexes assembled by both systems . In the five - protein system , Hip prevents inhibition of assembly by the hsp70 co - chaperone BAG - 1 , and cotransfection of Hip with BAG - 1 opposes BAG - 1 reduction of steroid binding activity in COS cells . We conclude that Hip is not a component of the assembly machinery but that it could play a regulatory role in opposition to BAG - 1 . Cutting edge : STAT6 - deficient mice have enhanced tumor immunity to primary and metastatic mammary carcinoma . STAT4 and STAT6 are essential for the development of CD4 ( + ) Th1 and Th2 development , respectively . Tumor immunologists have hypothesized that Th1 cells are critical in tumor immunity because they facilitate differentiation of CD8 ( + ) T cells , which are potent anti - tumor effectors . We have used STAT4 ( - / - ) and STAT6 ( - / - ) mice to test this hypothesis . BALB / c and knockout mice were challenged in the mammary gland with the highly malignant and spontaneously metastatic BALB / c - derived 4T1 mammary carcinoma . Primary tumor growth and metastatic disease are reduced in STAT6 ( - / - ) mice relative to BALB / c and STAT4 ( - / - ) mice . Ab depletions demonstrate that the effect is mediated by CD8 ( + ) T cells , and immunized STAT6 ( - / - ) mice have higher levels of 4T1 - specific CTL than BALB / c or STAT4 ( - / - ) mice . Surprisingly , Th1 or Th2 cells are not involved , because CD4 depletion does not diminish the anti - tumor effect . Therefore , deletion of the STAT6 gene facilitates development of potent anti - tumor immunity via a CD4 ( + ) - independent pathway . Activation of oncogenic transcription factor AP - 1 in T cells infected with human T cell leukemia virus type 1 . Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV - 1 ) Tax protein transforms primary human T cells in vitro . We previously showed that Tax induces the expression of various family members of the transcription factor AP - 1 such as c - Jun , JunD , c - Fos , and Fra - 1 at the mRNA level in T cells . In this study , we have examined the ability of Tax to activate transcription through the AP - 1 - binding site ( AP - 1 site ) . A transient transfection study showed that Tax can activate transcription through the AP - 1 - binding site in a human T cell line , whereas any combination of AP - 1 proteins did so much less than Tax , indicating that the activation of the AP - 1 site by Tax may require a mechanism other than the induction of AP - 1 mRNA . Fresh peripheral blood leukemia cells of all surveyed ATL patients displayed constitutive AP - 1 DNA - binding activity , whereas no normal individuals did . However , the HTLV - 1 genes , including tax , are not significantly expressed in fresh leukemia cells from ATL patients . Our present results suggest that activation of AP - 1 occurs through Tax - dependent and - independent mechanisms in HTLV - 1 - infected T cells , which may play some roles in dysregulated phenotypes of HTLV - 1 - infected cells . 2 , 2 ' , 4 , 6 , 6 ' - pentachlorobiphenyl induces apoptosis in human monocytic cells . Polychlorinatedbiphe ( PCBs ) are a group of persistent and widely dispersed environmental pollutants , some of which may be immunotoxic . In the present study , we investigated the effect of PCBs on immune system by assessing apoptotic cell death in human monocytic U937 cells . Among the various congeners tested , 2 , 2 ' , 4 , 6 , 6 ' - pentachlorobiphenyl ( PeCB ) , a highly ortho - substituted congener , specifically induced DNA fragmentation , a hallmark of apoptosis , while the other examined di - , tri - , tetra - , and pentachlorobiphenyls did not . To further study the 2 , 2 ' , 4 , 6 , 6 ' - PeCB - induced cell death , various features of apoptosis were examined . 2 , 2 ' , 4 , 6 , 6 ' - PeCB caused a decrease in cell viability and induced cellular morphologic features characteristic of apoptosis such as chromatin aggregation and apoptotic bodies . In addition , caspase - 3 , an executioner of apoptosis , was activated and its substrate , poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) , was cleaved during 2 , 2 ' , 4 , 6 , 6 ' - PeCB - induced apoptosis . In contrast , 3 , 3 ' , 4 , 4 ' , 5 - PeCB , a congener of coplanar structure , as well as 2 , 3 , 7 , 8 - TCDD did not induce apoptosis in these human monocytic cells , although they potently induced CYP 1A1 in human hepatoma Hep G2 cells . Taken together , the data indicate that 2 , 2 ' , 4 , 6 , 6 ' - PeCB induces apoptosis in human monocytic cells through a mechanism that is independent of the arylhydrocarbon receptor . This suggests a possibly separate mechanism by which PCBs cause immunosuppression . Effects of deregulated Raf activation on integrin , cytokine - receptor expression and the induction of apoptosis in hematopoietic cells . The effects of deregulated Raf activation on the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells were investigated . The cytokine - dependent murine myeloid FDC - P1 and human erythroleukemic TF - 1 cell lines were transformed to grow in response to deregulated Raf expression in the absence of exogenous cytokines . The conditionally active Raf proteins were regulated by beta - estradiol as cDNAs containing the Raf catalytic , but lacking negative - regulatory domains , were ligated to the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor ( deltaRaf : ER ) . Continuous deltaRaf expression prevented apoptosis in the absence of exogenous cytokines and altered the morphology of the FD / deltaRaf : ER cells as they grew in large aggregated masses ( > 100 cells ) whereas the parental cytokine - dependent FDC - P1 cells grew in smaller grape - like clusters ( < 10 cells ) . FD / deltaRaf - 1 : ER cells growing in response to Raf activation displayed decreased levels of the Mac - 2 and Mac - 3 molecules on their cell surface . In contrast , when these cells were cultured in IL - 3 , higher levels of these adhesion molecules were detected . Expression of activated Raf oncoproteins also abrogated cytokine dependency and prevented apoptosis of TF - 1 cells . Moreover , the differentiation status of these Raf - responsive cells was more immature upon Raf activation as culture with the differentiation - inducing agent phorbol 12 myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) and beta - estradiol resulted in decreased levels of the CD11b and CD18 integrin molecules on the cell surface . In contrast when the Raf - responsive cells were induced to differentiate with PMA and GM - CSF , in the absence of deltaRaf : ER activation , increased levels of the CD11b and CD18 molecules were detected . Retinoic acid ( RA ) inhibited 3H - thymidine incorporation in response to GM - CSF . Interestingly , Raf activation counterbalanced the inhibition of DNA synthesis caused by RA but not PMA . Thus deregulated Raf expression can alter cytokine dependency , integrin expression and the stage of differentiation . These Raf - responsive cell lines will be useful in elucidating the roles of the MAP kinase cascade on hematopoietic cell differentiation and malignant transformation Cyclic AMP activates p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase in Th2 cells : phosphorylation of GATA - 3 and stimulation of Th2 cytokine gene expression . cAMP is an important second messenger with immunomodulatory properties . Elevation of intracellular cAMP in T cells , induced by agents such as IL - 1alpha or PGs , inhibits T cell activation . In effector T cells , an increase in the level of intracellular cAMP inhibits cytokine production in Th1 cells but stimulates cytokine production in Th2 cells . Here we report that cAMP - induced effects in Th2 cells occur independently of the protein kinase A pathway , which is the major mediator of cAMP - induced signaling events in most cell types . Instead , cAMP stimulates activation of p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase in Th2 cells . This appears to be a Th2 - selective event because cAMP barely increased p38 phosphorylation in Th1 cells . We show that in Th2 cells , cAMP promotes the production of both IL - 5 and IL - 13 , which play distinct but critical roles in asthma pathogenesis . Our data also show that cAMP causes increased phosphorylation of the transcription factor GATA - 3 , which we have shown is a critical regulator of Th2 cytokine gene expression and , in turn , of airway inflammation in mice . Thus , Th2 - specific GATA - 3 expression and p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase activation together provide a molecular basis for the differential effects of cAMP in the two T helper cell subsets . Characterization of IL - 4 and IL - 13 signals dependent on the human IL - 13 receptor alpha chain 1 : redundancy of requirement of tyrosine residue for STAT3 activation . IL - 4 and IL - 13 are pleiotropic cytokines whose biological activities overlap with each other . IL - 13 receptor alpha chain 1 ( IL - 13R alpha 1 ) is necessary for binding to IL - 13 , and the heterodimer composed of IL - 13R alpha 1 and IL - 4R alpha chain transduces IL - 13 and IL - 4 signals ; however , the functional mapping of the intracellular domain of IL - 13R alpha 1 is not fully understood . In this study , we constructed wild and mutated types of human IL - 13R alpha 1 , and analyzed IL - 4 and IL - 13 signals using an IL - 13R alpha 1 - transfected human B cell line . Expression of IL - 13R alpha 1 evoked STAT3 activation by IL - 4 and IL - 13 , and in stimulated human B cells , on which IL - 13R alpha 1 was highly expressed , IL - 4 and IL - 13 induced STAT3 activation . Replacement of the two tyrosine residues completely abolished STAT3 activation , although replacing either tyrosine residue alone retained it . Furthermore , we found that the Box1 region and the C - terminal tail of IL - 13R alpha 1 were critical for binding to Tyk2 , and activation of Jak1 , Tyk2 , the insulin receptor substrate - 1 and STAT6 respectively . These results suggest that STAT3 activation is involved with IL - 4 and IL - 13 signals in human B cells along with the activation of STAT6 , and that there is a unique sequence in IL - 13R alpha 1 to activate STAT3 . Functional uncoupling of the Janus kinase 3 - Stat5 pathway in malignant growth of human T cell leukemia virus type 1 - transformed human T cells . Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV - 1 ) transforms cytokine - dependent T lymphocytes and causes adult T cell leukemia . Janus tyrosine kinase ( Jak ) 3 and transcription factors Stat5a and Stat5b are essential for the proliferation of normal T cells and are constitutively hyperactivated in both HTLV - 1 - transformed human T cell lines and lymphocytes isolated from HTLV - 1 - infected patients ; therefore , a critical role for the Jak3 - Stat5 pathway in the progression of this disease has been postulated . We recently reported that tyrphostin AG - 490 selectively blocked IL - 2 activation of Jak3 / Stat5 and growth of murine T cell lines . Here we demonstrate that disruption of Jak3 / Stat5a / b signaling with AG - 490 ( 50 & mgr ; M ) blocked the proliferation of primary human T lymphocytes , but paradoxically failed to inhibit the proliferation of HTLV - 1 - transformed human T cell lines , HuT - 102 and MT - 2 . Structural homologues of AG - 490 also inhibited the proliferation of primary human T cells , but not HTLV - 1 - infected cells . Disruption of constitutive Jak3 / Stat5 activation by AG - 490 was demonstrated by inhibition of 1 ) tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 , Stat5a ( Tyr ( 694 ) ) , and Stat5b ( Tyr ( 699 ) ) ; 2 ) serine phosphorylation of Stat5a ( Ser ( 726 ) ) as determined by a novel phosphospecific Ab ; and 3 ) Stat5a / b DNA binding to the Stat5 - responsive beta - casein promoter . In contrast , AG - 490 had no effect on DNA binding by p50 / p65 components of NF - kappaB , a transcription factor activated by the HTLV - 1 - encoded phosphoprotein , Tax . Collectively , these data suggest that the Jak3 - Stat5 pathway in HTLV - 1 - transformed T cells has become functionally redundant for proliferation . Reversal of this functional uncoupling may be required before Jak3 / Stat5 inhibitors will be useful in the treatment of this malignancy . The Epstein - Barr virus promoter initiating B - cell transformation is activated by RFX proteins and the B - cell - specific activator protein BSAP / Pax5 . Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) - induced B - cell growth transformation , a central feature of the virus ' strategy for colonizing the human B - cell system , requires full virus latent gene expression and is initiated by transcription from the viral promoter Wp . Interestingly , when EBV accesses other cell types , this growth - transforming program is not activated . The present work focuses on a region of Wp which in reporter assays confers B - cell - specific activity . Bandshift studies indicate that this region contains three factor binding sites , termed sites B , C , and D , in addition to a previously characterized CREB site . Here we show that site C binds members of the ubiquitously expressed RFX family of proteins , notably RFX1 , RFX3 , and the associated factor MIBP1 , whereas sites B and D both bind the B - cell - specific activator protein BSAP / Pax5 . In reporter assays with mutant Wp constructs , the loss of factor binding to any one of these sites severely impaired promoter activity in B cells , while the wild - type promoter could be activated in non - B cells by ectopic BSAP expression . We suggest that Wp regulation by BSAP helps to ensure the B - cell specificity of EBV ' s growth - transforming function . Activation of the Lck tyrosine protein kinase by the Herpesvirus saimiri tip protein involves two binding interactions . The Tip protein of Herpesvirus saimiri strain 484C binds to and activates the Lck tyrosine protein kinase . Two sequences in the Tip protein were previously shown to be involved in binding to Lck . A proline - rich region , residues 132 - 141 , binds to the SH3 domain of the Lck protein . We show here that the other Lck - binding domain , residues 104 - 113 , binds to the carboxyl - terminal half of Lck and that this binding does not require the Lck SH3 domain . Mutated Tip containing only one functional Lck - binding domain can bind stably to Lck , although not as strongly as wild - type Tip . Interaction of Tip with Lck through either Lck - binding domain increases the activity of Lck in vivo . Simultaneous binding of both domains is required for maximal activation of Lck . The transient expression of Tip in T cells was found to stimulate both Stat3 - dependent and NF - AT - dependent transcription . Mutant forms of Tip lacking one or the other of the two Lck - binding domains retained the ability to stimulate Stat3 - dependent transcription . Tip lacking the proline - rich Lck - binding domain exhibited almost wild - type activity in this assay . In contrast , ablation of either Lck - binding domain abolished the ability of Tip to stimulate NF - AT - dependent transcription . Full biological activity of Tip , therefore , appears to require both Lck - binding domains . Accumulation of RXR alpha during activation of cycling human T lymphocytes : modulation of RXRE transactivation function by mitogen - activated protein kinase pathways . We have previously reported that the activation of resting human immature peripheral blood T ( PBT ) lymphocytes is associated with the loss of retinoid X receptor alpha ( RXRalpha ) expression . In the present study , we have demonstrated that , unlike resting cells , activation of cycling human mature PBT lymphocytes , and T lymphocyte leukemia cell lines is accompanied by the accumulation of RXRalpha mRNA and protein . Interestingly , cyclosporin A further augmented RXRalpha expression , indicating the involvement of calcineurin pathways in the process . 9 - cis retinoic acid inhibited the accumulation , suggesting that retinoids can regulate the synthesis of their own receptors during T cell activation . Transfection analysis in Jurkat cells , using RXRE - dependent reporter assays , showed that RXRalpha accumulated during T cell activation was transcriptionally inactive . To investigate the mechanism of such inhibition , the role of two mitogen - activated protein kinase pathways , c - Jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK ) and extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) , in modulating RXRE - dependent transcription , was explored . The expression of constitutively active MAP / ERK kinase kinase 1 ( MEKK1 ) inhibited RXRE - dependent transcription , whereas dominant negative MEKK1 increased the transcription , indicating the involvement of JNK signaling pathways in the process . In contrast , expression of constitutively active MEK1 , which activates ERK pathway , enhanced RXRE - dependent activation . When both were activated simultaneously , JNK pathway was dominant over ERK pathway and resulted in inhibition of RXRE - mediated transcription . These data demonstrate a dual regulatory control of RXRalpha expression during the activation of resting and cycling T lymphocytes and indicate a dynamic balance between JNK and ERK pathways in modulating RXRE - mediated transactivation . The proteasome regulates receptor - mediated endocytosis of interleukin - 2 . Recent studies have increasingly implicated the proteasome in the regulation of cell surface receptors . In the present study , we investigated the role of the proteasome for ligand - dependent endocytosis and degradation of the interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) - interleukin - 2 receptor ( IL - 2R ) complex . Proteasome inhibitors impaired internalization of IL - 2 . IL - 2R and prevented the lysosomal degradation of this cytokine . Based on time - course studies , proteasome activity is primarily required after initial endocytosis of the IL - 2 . IL - 2R . Proteasome function was also necessary for the lysosomal degradation of IL - 2 internalized by IL - 2R that were comprised of cytoplasmic tailless beta - or gamma c - subunits , suggesting that the target protein for the proteasome is independent of either the cytoplasmic tail of the IL - 2R beta - or gamma c - subunits and their associated signaling components . Therefore , a functional proteasome is required for optimal endocytosis of the IL - 2R / ligand complex and is essential for the subsequent lysosomal degradation of IL - 2 , possibly by regulating trafficking to the lysosome . Functional characterization of the two alternative promoters of human p45 NF - E2 gene . OBJECTIVE : The transcription factor NF - E2 , a heterodimeric protein complex composed of p45 and small Maf family proteins , is considered crucial for the proper differentiation of erythrocytes and megakaryocytes in vivo . We report the results of studies aimed at understanding the regulatory mechanisms controlling p45 gene expression in erythroid cells . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Human p45 mRNAs have two alternative isoforms , aNF - E2 and fNF - E2 , and these isoforms are transcribed from the alternative promoters . We investigated lineage - specific expression of both isomers in human erythroid and megakaryocytic cells by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or Northern blot analysis . For functional characterization of both promoters , plasmids in which reporter genes were placed under the control of a series of truncated or mutated promoter fragments were transfected to human hematopoietic cell lines . RESULTS : When CD34 ( + ) cells isolated from human cord blood were induced to unilineage erythroid or megakaryocytic differentiation in liquid suspension culture , both transcripts , although barely detected at day 0 , were induced in both erythroid and megakaryocytic cultures . fNF - E2 mRNA was found to be more abundant in erythroid cells than megakaryocytic cells at day 7 of culture . Although both isomers were expressed in human erythroid - megakaryocytic cell lines , megakaryocytic maturation with loss of erythroid phenotype induced by phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) resulted in exclusive downregulation of fNF - E2 , suggesting that fNF - E2 promoter is more erythroid specific . Functional analysis of fNF - E2 promoter showed that the promoter is active only in erythroid - megakaryocytic cells and that the double GATA sit e in the proximal region is necessary for its efficient activity . CONCLUSION : These results suggest that GATA proteins , which govern the differentiation of erythroid lineage cells , are required for full promoter activity of the p45 gene . Transcriptional activation of heme oxygenase - 1 and its functional significance in acetaminophen - induced hepatitis and hepatocellular injury in the rat . BACKGROUND / AIM : Glutathione depletion contributes to acetaminophen hepatotoxicity and is known to induce the oxidative stress reactant heme oxygenase - 1 . The metabolites of the heme oxygenase pathway , biliverdin , carbon monoxide , and iron may modulate acetaminophen toxicity . The aim of this study was to assess cell - type specific expression of heme oxygenase - 1 and its impact on liver injury and microcirculatory disturbances in a model of acetaminophen - induced hepatitis . METHODS : Gene expression of heme oxygenase - 1 was studied by Northern - and Western analysis as well as immunohistochemistry . The time course of heme oxygenase - 1 and - 2 , cytokine - induced neutrophil chemoattractant - 1 , and intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 was studied by Northern analysis . DNA - binding activity of nuclear factor - kappaB was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay . Sinusoidal perfusion and leukocyte - endothelial interactions were assessed by intravital microscopy . RESULTS : Acetaminophen caused a moderate sinusoidal perfusion failure ( - 15 % ) and infiltration of neutrophils along with activation of nuclear factor - kappaB and intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 and cytokine - induced neutrophil chemoattractant - 1 mRNAs . Induction of heme oxygenase - 1 mRNA and protein ( approximately 30 - fold ) in hepatocytes and non - parenchymal cells paralleled the inflammatory response . Blockade of heme oxygenase activity with tin - protoporphyrin - IX abrogated acetaminophen - induced hepatic neutrophil accumulation and nuclear factor - kappaB activation , but failed to affect sinusoidal perfusion and liver injury . CONCLUSIONS : The inflammatory response associated with acetaminophen hepatotoxicity is modulated by the parallel induction of the heme oxygenase - 1 gene . However , heme oxygenase - 1 has no permissive effect on sinusoidal perfusion and does not affect liver injury in this model . These data argue against a central role of nuclear factor - kappaB activation and neutrophil infiltration as perpetuating factors of liver injury in acetaminophen toxicity . Tumor necrosis factor - alpha - induced proliferation requires synthesis of granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor . OBJECTIVE : Tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF - alpha ) induces a variety of cellular responses , some of them being at least seemingly contradictory . Thus , we set out to find differences in the modes of proliferative and apoptotic responses to TNF - alpha . MATERIALS AND METHODS : We screened a panel of acute myeloid leukemia - derived cell lines for TNF - alpha - responsiveness . In two lines ( OCI - AML - 1 , OCI - AML - 11 ) , TNF - alpha acted as an apoptotic agent ; in others ( HU - 3 , M - 07e , TF - 1 ) , it had the opposite effect , preventing apoptosis and inducing proliferation . Direct and indirect signaling mechanisms , including NF - kappaB activation and cytokine synthesis , were analyzed . RESULTS : All cell lines tested expressed TNF - alpha receptors I and II and responded to TNF - alpha by upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 . In contrast to granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) , TNF - alpha did not activate the MAP kinase and p70S6 kinase pathways . Nevertheless , inhibitors of these pathways clearly reduced the TNF - alpha - induced cell growth , indicating that TNF - alpha - proliferative cells produced a growth factor that induced proliferation upon stimulation of the above pathways . Anti - GM - CSF antibodies inhibited the TNF - alpha - induced growth , suggesting the presence of an autocrine loop for cell proliferation mediated by GM - CSF . Supporting this notion , TNF - alpha - induced upregulation of GM - CSF mRNA levels and protein secretion in the TNF - alpha - proliferative , but not in the TNF - alpha - apoptotic cell lines . CONCLUSION : These data identify GM - CSF synthesis as an early and essential step in TNF - alpha - induced proliferation . We show for the first time that TNF - alpha - treated cell lines producing no or only minimal amounts of GM - CSF demonstrate an apoptotic phenotype , while cell lines with high GM - CSF expression rates can escape from growth arrest or even apoptosis . In this context , we discuss arguments pointing at NF - kappaB as regulator of GM - CSF synthesis and thus indirectly as regulator for the escape of TNF - alpha - induced apoptosis Glucocorticoid receptor content of T lymphocytes : evidence for heterogeneity . Glucocorticoid receptors were measured in T lymphocytes that were isolated from peripheral blood by either nylon wool filtration or E - rosette sedimentation . T cells isolated by nylon wool filtration specifically bind 6 . 7 + / - 0 . 2 fmol of dexamethasone per million cells ( equivalent to 4000 + / - 200 receptors per cell ) , whereas T cells isolated by E - rosette sedimentation bind 12 . 0 + / - 0 . 7 fmol of dexamethasone per million cells ( equivalent to 7200 + / - 400 receptors per cell ) . This difference in the amount of dexamethasone bound by the two T cell preparations was significant ( p less than . 001 ) and was present immediately after cell isolation . The binding affinities of the different T cell preparations for dexamethasone were similar . T cells that are isolated by a combination of nylon wool filtration followed by E - rosette sedimentation bind the same amount of dexamethasone as T cells isolated by nylon wool filtration alone . T cells isolated by a combination of E - rosette sedimentation following by nylon wool filtration bind less dexamethasone than do T cells isolated by E - rosette sedimentation alone . These findings suggest that T cells are heterogeneous with respect to their quantity of glucocorticoid receptors . Isolation of T cells by E - rosette sedimentation enriches for T cells that have a greater number of glucocorticoid receptors , and isolation of T cells by nylon wool filtration enriches for T cells that have a lesser number of glucocorticoid receptors . Glucocorticoid receptors and glucocorticoid sensitivity of human leukemic cells . We have established optimal conditions for the measurement of glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) in human white cells using a whole - cell binding assay with [ 3H ] dexamethasone as the ligand , and the subsequent determination of the GR content in normal human lymphocytes and in leukemic cells of patients with various forms of acute and chronic leukemia . A number of leukemia cell lines in continuous culture were also subjected to the GR assay , and the results were correlated with the sensitivity of these cell lines to glucocorticoid steroids in vitro . The GR content of normal human lymphocytes amounted to 4 , 850 + / - 1 , 340 ( mean + / - SD ) receptors / cell . The mean equilibrium dissociation constant ( KD ) of the interaction of [ 3H ] dexamethasone with the GR was 1 . 2 x 10 ( - 8 ) M . Steroidal compounds with a known glucocorticoid potency effectively competed for the binding , whereas steroids devoid of glucocorticoid activity ( e . g . estradiol - 17 beta and testosterone ) were ineffective . The GR content of the blast cells obtained from eight patients suffering from acute leukemia and four patients with a blast crisis of chronic myelocytic leukemia was found to be highly variable ( 3 , 230 - 29 , 900 receptors / cell ) , while the lymphocytes of six patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia contained a rather stable GR content ( 2 , 930 - 5 , 120 receptors / cell ) , which was comparable with that of normal lymphocytes . GR was identified in all the 12 malignant continuous white cell lines studied . Large cells contained more GR than the smaller ones . There was no apparent correlation between the GR concentration and the sensitivity of the cells in vitro to glucocorticoids as judged by [ 3H ] thymidine incorporation studies . Distribution of the surface markers in the leukemic cell lines did not relate to the GR concentration . We conclude that the presence of GR is probably a universal feature of the leukemic cells , and , from a clinical standpoint , probably does not alone imply steroid responsiveness . Evidence for a steroid receptor in rheumatoid synovial tissue cells . One mechanism by which glucocorticoids could exert their anti - inflammatory action is via rapidly saturable , stereo - specific cytoplasmic protein receptors . This report is of an investigation into such a possibility in synovial cells . Synovium , obtained from knee joints of rheumatoid patients undergoing surgery , was incubated with clostridiopeptidase A and trypsin - EDTA to obtain cell suspensions . These , together with cells obtained from synovial fluid aspirated from patients with rheumatoid arthritis , were identified by electron microscopy . Duplicate samples of these cell suspensions were incubated with increasing concentrations of H3Dexamethasone ( 1 x 10 ( - 10 ) M - 1 x 10 ( - 9 ) M ) for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C . Analysis of the proportion of steroid bound to whole cells showed evidence for specific , rapidly saturable , receptors in the cells obtained from synovial tissue , but this was not found in synovial fluid cells . Electron micrographs showed that cells obtained from synovial tissue consisted of synovial fibroblast - and macrophage - types , lymphocytes , monocytes and macrophages . Polymorphonuclear leucocytes appeared to be absent . However , in synovial fluid cell type polymorphonuclear leucocytes were the predominant cell type . We concluded from this , that one or more of the cell types present in synovial tissue contain a specific steroid receptor , but that this is lacking in synovial fluid polymorphonuclear leucocytes . Clinical implications of glucocorticoid receptors in human leukemia . Glucorticoid receptors were studied in various populations of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes and leukemic lymphoblasts . Normal lymphocytes contain low levels of glucocorticoid receptor ( approximately 2 , 500 sites / cell ) which are identical in T - and non - T - fractions . Phytohemagglutinin treatment increases levels about 3 - fold . Leukemic lymphoblasts contain larger numbers of receptor sites . Presence of receptor is correlated with in vitro sensitivitiy to glucocorticoids and in vivo response to therapy . Quantity of receptor is also correlated with complete remission duration independently of leukemic cell type ( T or null ) , initial WBC , or age of patient . Quantitative determination of glucocorticoid receptor levels in acute lymphoblastic leukemia may be of value both as an independent prognostic variable and in suggesting which patients should receive glucocorticoid therapy . Functional and physical interaction of protein - tyrosine kinases Fyn and Csk in the T - cell signaling system . The Src - like protein - tyrosine kinase Fyn is associated with T - cell antigen receptor . Transient expression of actively mutated Fyn , having Phe - 528 instead of Tyr - 528 or Thr - 338 instead of Ile - 338 , in Jurkat T - cells stimulated the serum response element ( SRE ) , 12 - O - tetradecanoyl - phorbol - 13 - acetate response element , cyclic AMP response element , and c - fos promoter . The stimulation of SRE was particularly prominent not only with active Fyn but also with normal ( wild - type ) Fyn . SRE was also stimulated by both normal and active Lck . Furthermore , normal and active Fyn stimulated transcription from the IL - 2 gene promoter when transfected cells were stimulated by concanavalin A plus 12 - O - tetradecanoylphorbol - 13 - acetate . Under the same conditions , Lck did not stimulate IL - 2 promoter unless it was activated by mutation . Interestingly , a mutant Fyn , which has deletions within the SH2 region and so is able to transform chicken embryo fibroblasts , did not stimulate either the c - fos or IL - 2 promoter , suggesting the importance of this region in T - cell signaling . Csk , which phosphorylates tyrosine residues in the negative regulatory sites of Src family kinases , down - regulated Fyn - and Lck - mediated stimulation of the serum response element and Fyn - mediated enhancement of IL - 2 promoter activity . These data suggest that Fyn and Lck , whose activities are regulated by Csk , are involved in different phases of T - cell activation . A novel NF - kappa B complex containing p65 homodimers : implications for transcriptional control at the level of subunit dimerization . The predominant inducible form of the NF - kappa B transcription factor is a heteromeric complex containing two Rel - related DNA - binding subunits , termed p65 and p50 . Prior transfection studies have shown that when these p65 and p50 subunits are expressed independently as stable homodimers , p65 stimulates kappa B - directed transcription , whereas p50 functions as a kappa B - specific repressor . While authentic p50 homodimers ( previously termed KBF1 ) have been detected in nuclear extracts from nontransfected cells , experimental evidence supporting the existence of p65 homodimers in vivo was lacking . We now provide direct biochemical evidence for the presence of an endogenous pool of inducible p65 homodimers in intact human T cells . As with the prototypical NF - kappa B p50 - p65 heterodimer , this novel p65 homodimeric form of NF - kappa B is functionally sequestered in the cytoplasm but rapidly appears in the nuclear compartment following cellular stimulation . Site - directed mutagenesis studies indicate that the homodimerization function of p65 is dependent upon the presence of cysteine 216 and a conserved recognition motif for protein kinase A ( RRPS ; amino acids 273 to 276 ) , both of which reside within a 91 - amino - acid segment of the Rel homology domain that mediates self - association . In contrast , mutations at these two sites do not affect heterodimerization of p65 with p50 or its functional interaction with I kappa B alpha . These later findings indicate that neither homo - nor heterodimer formation is an absolute prerequisite for I kappa B alpha recognition of p65 . Taken together with prior in vivo transcription studies , these results suggest that the biological activities of p65 and p50 homodimers are independently regulated , thereby providing an integrated and flexible control mechanism for the rapid activation and repression of NF - kappa B / Rel - directed gene expression . Carrier determination for X - linked agammaglobulinemia using X inactivation analysis of purified B cells . We report the development of a relatively quick and simple method for the assessment of X inactivation status for carrier determination in families affected by X - linked agammaglobulinemia ( XLA ) . This method utilises an immunomagnetic separation technique for B cell purification and a polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) based assay for the determination of methylation status at the androgen receptor ( AR ) gene locus to assess whether X inactivation is random or non - random at this locus . We report the results we have obtained using this assay to investigate females known to be carriers of various X - linked immunodeficiency disorders . In addition , we investigated four females from different families affected by XLA , two of whom were of unknown carrier status , and we discuss the results obtained with this and other X - inactivation assays . A similar assay has recently been described by Allen et al . ( 1992 ) and applied to members of one family affected by XLA . Effects of IL - 4 and Fc gamma receptor II engagement on Egr - 1 expression during stimulation of B lymphocytes by membrane immunoglobulin crosslinking . Egr - 1 is an immediate early gene that is rapidly upregulated in response to mitogenic signals induced by antigen receptor crosslinking on murine B lymphocytes . It has been shown that levels of Egr - 1 expression are closely correlated with B cell proliferation in several models of B cell activation and tolerance . We compared the expression of Egr - 1 during B cell stimulation with Fab ' 2 and IgG anti - immunoglobulin ( anti - Ig ) , since it is known that Fab ' 2 anti - Ig is mitogenic while IgG anti - Ig is not , owing to a dominant inhibitory effect of crosslinking the B cell Fc gamma RII to membrane Ig . While mitogenic doses of Fab ' 2 anti - Ig induce large and rapid increases in Egr - 1 expression , IgG anti - Ig results in smaller increases in Egr - 1 mRNA , comparable to that seen with submitogenic concentrations of Fab ' 2 anti - Ig . However , the correlation between Egr - 1 expression and B cell proliferation breaks down when IL - 4 is added as a co - mitogen to induce B cell proliferation with IgG anti - Ig or submitogenic concentrations of Fab ' 2 anti - Ig . No corresponding increases in Egr - 1 mRNA levels are observed when IL - 4 is added . Therefore , IL - 4 overcomes Fc receptor - mediated inhibition of B cell proliferation without affecting inhibition of Egr - 1 mRNA induction , as demonstrated earlier for c - myc mRNA in this system . Identification of a novel cyclosporin - sensitive element in the human tumor necrosis factor alpha gene promoter . Tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - alpha ) , a cytokine with pleiotropic biological effects , is produced by a variety of cell types in response to induction by diverse stimuli . In this paper , TNF - alpha mRNA is shown to be highly induced in a murine T cell clone by stimulation with T cell receptor ( TCR ) ligands or by calcium ionophores alone . Induction is rapid , does not require de novo protein synthesis , and is completely blocked by the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A ( CsA ) . We have identified a human TNF - alpha promoter element , kappa 3 , which plays a key role in the calcium - mediated inducibility and CsA sensitivity of the gene . In electrophoretic mobility shift assays , an oligonucleotide containing kappa 3 forms two DNA protein complexes with proteins that are present in extracts from unstimulated T cells . These complexes appear in nuclear extracts only after T cell stimulation . Induction of the inducible nuclear complexes is rapid , independent of protein synthesis , and blocked by CsA , and thus , exactly parallels the induction of TNF - alpha mRNA by TCR ligands or by calcium ionophore . Our studies indicate that the kappa 3 binding factor resembles the preexisting component of nuclear factor of activated T cells . Thus , the TNF - alpha gene is an immediate early gene in activated T cells and provides a new model system in which to study CsA - sensitive gene induction in activated T cells . Differences in expression of transcription factor AP - 1 in human promyelocytic HL - 60 cells during differentiation towards macrophages versus granulocytes . Commitment of HL - 60 cells to macrophage or granulocytic differentiation was achieved by incubation with 4 beta - phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) for 30 - 60 min or with dimethyl sulphoxide ( DMSO ) for 24 h respectively . The commitment stage towards PMA - induced macrophage differentiation was associated with increases in jun B and c - fos mRNA levels , as well as with an increase in the binding activity of transcription factor AP - 1 . Nevertheless , gel retardation analysis indicated that the AP - 1 activity detected in untreated cells was drastically reduced during the commitment stage of DMSO - induced HL - 60 differentiation towards granulocytes . When HL - 60 cells were treated with sodium butyrate , which induced monocytic differentiation , a remarkable increase in AP - 1 binding activity was detected . Treatment of HL - 60 cells with 1 alpha , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 , another monocytic differentiation agent , induced a weak , but appreciable , increase in AP - 1 activity . Furthermore , addition of sodium butyrate or 1 alpha , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 to HL - 60 cells induced the expression of c - fos , c - jun , jun B and jun D proto - oncogenes . In contrast , when HL - 60 cells were treated with retinoic acid , a granulocytic differentiation inducer , no enhanced AP - 1 binding activity was observed , and only a weak increase in jun D mRNA level was detected . These data indicate that formation of AP - 1 is not required for the induction of HL - 60 differentiation towards granulocytes , whereas induction of monocytic differentiation is correlated with an increase in AP - 1 activity . The differential expression of AP - 1 activity may be critical in the differentiation of HL - 60 cells towards monocytic or granulocytic lineages Glucocorticoid receptors and sensitivity in leukemias . In an attempt to investigate the utility of glucocorticoid receptor determination to predict clinical responsiveness in human leukemias we have studied glucocorticoid receptors in the leukemic cells from 46 patients and in the lymphocytes from 18 normal donors . In the normal lymphocytes there were 3 , 875 ( Median ) specific binding sites per cell . The blasts from 17 patients with ANLL had on average higher levels of binding sites per cell ( Median = 7 , 250 , range : 0 to 15 , 295 ) than the other leukemias . Of the 15 patients with CLL , six had received glucocorticoid treatment for 3 to 5 years . Their lymphocytes had lower number of receptors ( Median = 2 , 000 ) than the other cases which were newly diagnosed ( Median = 4 , 500 ) . Four patients had ALL / AUL , three patients had blast crisis as terminal phase of CML , and seven had leukemic Non - Hodgkin lymphomas ( Median = 3 , 500 sites / cell ) . In 24 patients we have also studied the in vitro sensitivity of the leukemic cells to dexamethasone . There was no marked correlation between glucocorticoid receptor levels and in vitro sensitivity . An attempt to correlate receptor levels with clinical responsiveness demonstrated that glucocorticoid receptor determination might be of value in patients with lymphoid malignancies but probably not in patients with other leukemias . ' Activation - labile ' glucocorticoid - receptor complexes of a steroid - resistant variant of CEM - C7 human lymphoid cells . For cytoplasmic glucocorticoid - receptor complexes to enter and accumulate in the nucleus a temperature - dependent event , ' activation ' is required . Activation can be achieved in vitro by increased ionic strength , dilution or gel filtration and is manifested by an increased affinity of steroid - receptor complex for DNA and an altered elution profile from ion - exchange resins . Munck and Foley have shown that activated complexes isolated from thymocytes elute from DEAE - cellulose in a manner identical to complexes activated in vitro . We report here that DEAE - cellulose chromatography of steroid - receptor complexes from CEM - C7 , a cloned human leukaemic T - cell line sensitive to the cytolytic action of glucocorticoids , and its steroid - resistant subclone 4R4 demonstrated that steroid receptors of clone 4R4 can not form stable activated complexes . This defines a new defect in receptor action , activation lability ( r + act1 ) , which is unlike either the r - , r + nt - , or r + nti phenotypes previously described for mouse lymphoid variants . Granulocytes in the endometrium of post - partum women . Endometrial samples of women at various stages of gonadal activity after parturition were examined for the presence and numbers of endometrial granulocytes . Although samples at all the stages contained significant numbers of the granulocytes ( i . e . greater than 7 / high - power field ) , the 100 % values for late - proliferative and adaptation hyperplasia were significantly higher than the values for the resting ( 81 . 8 % ) , early ( 82 . 4 % ) and mid - ( 87 . 9 % ) proliferative and secretory ( 83 . 3 % ) phases . We suggest that this correlates with the suggestion that the granulocytes constitute a receptor system for oestrogens . Interaction of glucocorticoids with macrophages . Identification of glucocorticoid receptors in monocytes and macrophages . Glucocorticoid binding was measured in resident and thioglycollate - elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages , rabbit alveolar macrophages , and human monocytes . Two assays of binding were used - - an assay with intact cells in suspension or monolayers , and an assay of cytosol and nuclear forms of glucocorticoid receptors . The mononuclear phagocytes contained approximately equal to 4 - - 10 X 10 ( 3 ) high affinity receptor sites per cell , with dissociation constants of approximately equal to 2 - - 8 nM dexamethasone . The binding to the saturable sites was specific for steroids with glucocorticoid or antiglucocorticoid activity . Cortisol , corticosterone , and progesterone competed with dexamethasone for binding , whereas estradiol , dihydrotestosterone , and 11 - epicortisol competed very little . Binding of dexamethasone to cytosol and nuclear forms of the receptor complex and temperature - sensitive translocation of cytosol forms to nuclear forms were shown . At 37 degrees C the predominant form of the hormone - receptor complex was nuclear . These results demonstrate that corticosteroids interact with macrophages at physiological concentrations . Nitric oxide signaling : a possible role for G proteins . We have previously reported various inductive effects of nitric oxide on human PBMC . We describe a novel and potentially important mechanism of nitric oxide signaling - through direct activation of guanine nucleotide - binding proteins ( G proteins ) . We have found that nitric oxide treatment of membranes isolated from fresh human PBMC enhances the ability of these membranes to hydrolyze [ gamma - 32P ] GTP and bind [ gamma - 35S ] GTP . In addition , treatment of whole cells with nitric oxide yielded membranes with enhanced GTPase activity . Furthermore , the GTPase activity of pure , recombinant Gs alpha , Gi alpha 1 , and p21ras was greatly enhanced by nitric oxide . In support of the existence of this pathway in whole cells , we found that the G protein inhibitor , GDP - beta - S , blocked NF - kappa B translocation induced by nitric oxide or LPS in permeabilized cells . In addition , nitric oxide greatly reduced the pertussis toxin - mediated ADP - ribosylation of 45 - and 41 - kDa proteins in membranes of these cells . Because G proteins play a central role in many diverse signaling systems , activation by an endogenous and inducible oxidant may represent a novel signaling pathway . The granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor promoter cis - acting element CLE0 mediates induction signals in T cells and is recognized by factors related to AP1 and NFAT . Expression of the granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) gene in T cells is activated by the combination of phorbol ester ( phorbol myristate acetate ) and calcium ionophore ( A23187 ) , which mimic antigen stimulation through the T - cell receptor . We have previously shown that a fragment containing bp - 95 to + 27 of the mouse GM - CSF promoter can confer inducibility to reporter genes in the human Jurkat T - cell line . Here we use an in vitro transcription system to demonstrate that a cis - acting element ( positions - 54 to - 40 ) , referred to as CLE0 , is a target for the induction signals . We observed induction with templates containing intact CLE0 but not with templates with deleted or mutated CLE0 . We also observed that two distinct signals were required for the stimulation through CLE0 , since only extracts from cells treated with both phorbol myristate acetate and A23187 supported optimal induction . Stimulation probably was mediated by CLE0 - binding proteins because depletion of these proteins specifically reduced GM - CSF transcription . One of the binding factors possessed biochemical and immunological features identical to those of the transcription factor AP1 . Another factor resembled the T - cell - specific factor NFAT . The characteristics of these two factors are consistent with their involvement in GM - CSF induction . The presence of CLE0 - like elements in the promoters of interleukin - 3 ( IL - 3 ) , IL - 4 , IL - 5 , GM - CSF , and NFAT sites in the IL - 2 promoter suggests that the factors we detected , or related factors that recognize these sites , may account for the coordinate induction of these genes during T - cell activation . Identification and characterization of an Alu - containing , T - cell - specific enhancer located in the last intron of the human CD8 alpha gene . Expression of the human CD8 alpha gene is restricted to cells of the lymphoid lineage and developmentally regulated during thymopoiesis . As an initial step towards understanding the molecular basis for tissue - specific expression of this gene , we surveyed the surrounding chromatin structure for potential cis - acting regulatory regions by DNase I hypersensitivity mapping and found four hypersensitive sites , three of which were T cell restricted . By using a reporter - based expression approach , a T - cell - specific enhancer was identified by its close association with a prominent T - cell - restricted hypersensitive sites in the last intron of the CD8 alpha gene . Deletion studies demonstrated that the minimal enhancer is adjacent to a negative regulatory element . DNA sequence analysis of the minimal enhancer revealed a striking cluster of consensus binding sites for Ets - 1 , TCF - 1 , CRE , GATA - 3 , LyF - 1 , and bHLH proteins which were verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays . In addition , the 5 ' end of the enhancer was composed of an Alu repeat which contained the GATA - 3 , bHLH , and LyF - 1 binding sites . Site - directed mutation of the Ets - 1 and GATA - 3 sites dramatically reduced enhancer activity . The functional importance of the other binding sites only became apparent when combinations of mutations were analyzed . Taken together , these results suggest that the human CD8 alpha gene is regulated by the interaction of multiple T - cell nuclear proteins with a transcriptional enhancer located in the last intron of the gene . Comparison of the CD8 alpha enhancer with other recently identified T - cell - specific regulatory elements suggests that a common set of transcription factors regulates several T - cell genes . Molecular regulation of the human IL - 3 gene : inducible T cell - restricted expression requires intact AP - 1 and Elf - 1 nuclear protein binding sites . Interleukin 3 ( IL - 3 ) is a hematopoietic stem - cell growth and differentiation factor that is expressed solely in activated T and NK cells . Studies to date have identified elements 5 ' to the IL - 3 coding sequences that regulate its transcription , but the sequences that confer T cell - specific expression remain to be clearly defined . We have now identified DNA sequences that are required for T cell - restricted IL - 3 gene transcription . A series of transient transfections performed with human IL - 3 - chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter plasmids in T and non - T cells revealed that a plasmid containing 319 bp of 5 ' flanking sequences was active exclusively in T cells . Deletion analysis revealed that T cell specificity was conferred by a 49 - bp fragment ( bp - 319 to - 270 ) that included a potential binding site for AP - 1 transcription factors 6 bp upstream of a binding site for Elf - 1 , a member of the Ets family of transcription factors . DNaseI footprint and electrophoretic mobility shift assay analyses performed with MLA - 144 T cell nuclear extracts demonstrated that this 49 - bp region contains a nuclear protein binding region that includes consensus AP - 1 and Elf - 1 binding sites . In addition , extracts prepared from purified human T cells contained proteins that bound to synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the AP - 1 and Elf - 1 binding sites . In vitro - transcribed and - translated Elf - 1 protein bound specifically to the Elf - 1 site , and Elf - 1 antisera competed and super shifted nuclear protein complexes present in MLA - 144 nuclear extracts . Moreover , addition of anti - Jun family antiserum in electrophoretic mobility shift assay reactions completely blocked formation of the AP - 1 - related complexes . Transient transfection studies in MLA - 144 T cells revealed that constructs containing mutations in the AP - 1 site almost completely abolished CAT activity while mutation of the Elf - 1 site or the NF - IL - 3 site , a previously described nuclear protein binding site ( bp . - 155 to - 148 ) in the IL - 3 promoter , reduced CAT activity to < 25 % of the activity given by wild - type constructs . We conclude that expression of the human IL - 3 gene requires the AP - 1 and Elf - 1 binding sites ; however , unlike other previously characterized cytokine genes such as IL - 2 , the AP - 1 and Elf - 1 factors can bind independently in the IL - 3 gene . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS ) Combination IL - 2 and IL - 4 reduces glucocorticoid receptor - binding affinity and T cell response to glucocorticoids . The mechanisms contributing to persistent T cell activation and poor response to glucocorticoids in chronic inflammatory illnesses such as steroid resistant ( SR ) asthma are poorly defined . We examined the possibility that certain cytokines , specifically IL - 2 and IL - 4 , could affect T cell response to glucocorticoids . A [ 3H ] dexamethasone radioligand - binding assay was used to measure the number of glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) and dissociation constant ( Kd ) in PBMC from normal donors and patients with SR asthma , cultured in the absence and presence of these cytokines . PBMC from normal donors incubated for 48 h in the presence of combination IL - 2 + IL - 4 had nuclear GR with significantly reduced binding affinity ( GR Kd = 36 . 1 + / - 1 . 63 nM , mean + / - SEM ; p = 0 . 0001 ) as compared with PBMC incubated with medium alone ( GR Kd = 6 . 74 + / - 0 . 46 nM ) . The cytosolic GR Kd remained unchanged . However , when PBMC were incubated with IL - 2 alone or IL - 4 alone , no change in GR - binding affinity was observed . Furthermore , when T cells and non - T cells were individually stimulated with combination IL - 2 + IL - 4 , a significant reduction in GR - binding affinity was observed only in the T cell population ( p = 0 . 0001 ) . The IL - 2 + IL - 4 - induced alteration in PBMC GR Kd was associated with an increase in GR number ( 8348 + / - 964 vs 1710 + / - 228 sites / cell ; p = 0 . 0003 ) . More importantly , the alteration in PBMC GR - binding affinity with IL - 2 + IL - 4 was associated with a functional change in T cell response to methylprednisolone MPN , i . e . , a reduced inhibitory effect of MPN on PMA / ionomycin - induced T cell proliferation . These effects of IL - 2 + IL - 4 on PBMC GR affinity and response to MPN were blocked by co - incubation with IFN - gamma . Freshly isolated PBMC from four patients with SR asthma had a significantly reduced GR - binding affinity ( Kd = 40 . 0 + / - 2 . 68 nM ; p = 0 . 0001 ) when compared with seven normal subjects ( 7 . 15 + / - 0 . 41 nM ) . The altered PBMC GR binding from patients with SR asthma reversed to normal when incubated with medium alone , but was sustained with IL - 2 + IL - 4 . These observations suggest that with persistent inflammation certain cytokines may contribute to an impaired response to glucocorticoids . Furthermore , the effects of IL - 2 and IL - 4 were blocked by IFN - gamma . Characterization of the human CD4 gene promoter : transcription from the CD4 gene core promoter is tissue - specific and is activated by Ets proteins . We analyzed the 5 ' transcription control sequences of the human CD4 gene . We located the transcription initiation site and showed that the CD4 core promoter ( positions - 40 to + 16 ) lacks a classical ` ` TATA ' ' or initiator positioning consensus sequence but directs precise and efficient transcription when coupled to the ubiquitously active simian virus 40 enhancer . The transcriptional activity of the CD4 gene promoter correlated with CD4 expression in various cell types . Interestingly , the CD4 core promoter also displayed a tissue - specific transcriptional activity . Within this fragment , three nucleic acid sequences are completely conserved in the murine CD4 gene . One of these sequences contains a perfect ETS\""

       "\"IL - 2 gene expression and NF - kappa B activation through CD28 requires reactive oxygen production by 5 - lipoxygenase . Activation of the CD28 surface receptor provides a major costimulatory signal for T cell activation resulting in enhanced production of interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) and cell proliferation . In primary T lymphocytes we show that CD28 ligation leads to the rapid intracellular formation of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROIs ) which are required for CD28 - mediated activation of the NF - kappa B / CD28 - responsive complex and IL - 2 expression . Delineation of the CD28 signaling cascade was found to involve protein tyrosine kinase activity , followed by the activation of phospholipase A2 and 5 - lipoxygenase . These findings should be useful for therapeutic strategies and the development of immunosuppressants targeting the CD28 costimulatory pathway . The peri - kappa B site mediates human immunodeficiency virus type 2 enhancer activation in monocytes but not in T cells . HIV - 1 and HIV - 2 display significant differences in nucleic acid sequence and in the natural history of clinical disease . Consistent with these differences , we have previously demonstrated that the enhancer / promoter region of HIV - 2 functions quite differently from that of HIV - 1 . Whereas activation of the HIV - 1 enhancer following T - cell stimulation is mediated largely through binding of the transcription factor NF - kappa B to two adjacent kappa B sites in the HIV - 1 long terminal repeat , activation of the HIV - 2 enhancer in monocytes and T cells is dependent on four cis - acting elements : a single kappa B site , two purine - rich binding sites , PuB1 and PuB2 , and a pets site . We have now identified a novel cis - acting element within the HIV - 2 enhancer , immediately upstream of the kappa B site , designated peri - kappa B . This site is conserved among isolates of HIV - 2 and the closely related simian immunodeficiency virus , and transfection assays show this site to mediate HIV - 2 enhancer activation following stimulation of monocytic but not T - cell lines . Further , while specific constitutive binding to the peri - kappa B site is seen in monocytes , stimulation with phorbol esters induces additional , specific binding . E1A gene expression induces susceptibility to killing by NK cells following immortalization but not adenovirus infection of human cells . Adenovirus ( Ad ) infection and E1A transfection were used to model changes in susceptibility to NK cell killing caused by transient vs stable E1A expression in human cells . Only stably transfected target cells exhibited cytolytic susceptibility , despite expression of equivalent levels of E1A proteins in Ad - infected targets . The inability of E1A gene products to induce cytolytic susceptibility during infection was not explained by an inhibitory effect of viral infection on otherwise susceptible target cells or by viral gene effects on class I MHC antigen expression on target cells . This differential effect of E1A expression on the cytolytic phenotypes of infected and stably transfected human cells suggests that human NK cells provide an effective immunologic barrier against the in vivo survival and neoplastic progression of E1A - immortalized cells that may emerge from the reservoir of persistently infected cells in the human host . The CD4 coreceptor interacts with non - polymorphic regions of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules on antigen - presenting cells and contributes to T cell activation . We have investigated the effect of CD4 triggering on T cell activating signals in a lymphoma model using monoclonal antibodies ( mAb ) which recognize different CD4 epitopes . We demonstrate that CD4 triggering delivers signals capable of activating the NF - AT transcription factor which is required for interleukin - 2 gene expression . Lack of full activation of NF - AT could be correlated to a dramatically reduced capacity to induce calcium flux and could be complemented with a calcium ionophore . The results identify functionally distinct epitopes on the CD4 coreceptor involved in activation of the Ras / protein kinase C and calcium pathways . Ligand - dependent repression of the erythroid transcription factor GATA - 1 by the estrogen receptor . High - dose estrogen administration induces anemia in mammals . In chickens , estrogens stimulate outgrowth of bone marrow - derived erythroid progenitor cells and delay their maturation . This delay is associated with down - regulation of many erythroid cell - specific genes , including alpha - and beta - globin , band 3 , band 4 . 1 , and the erythroid cell - specific histone H5 . We show here that estrogens also reduce the number of erythroid progenitor cells in primary human bone marrow cultures . We demonstrate that the transcriptional activity of GATA - 1 is strongly repressed by the estrogen receptor ( ER ) in a ligand - dependent manner and that this repression is reversible in the presence of 4 - hydroxytamoxifen . GATA - 1 and ER bind to each other in vitro in the absence of DNA . Mapping experiments indicate that GATA - 1 and the ER form at least two contacts , which involve the finger region and the N - terminal activation domain of GATA - 1 . We speculate that estrogens exert effects on erythropoiesis by modulating GATA - 1 activity through protein - protein interaction with the ER . Mouse interleukin - 2 receptor alpha gene expression . Interleukin - 1 and interleukin - 2 control transcription via distinct cis - acting elements . We have shown that interleukin - 1 ( IL - 1 ) and IL - 2 control IL - 2 receptor alpha ( IL - 2R alpha ) gene transcription in CD4 - CD8 - murine T lymphocyte precursors . Here we map the cis - acting elements that mediate interleukin responsiveness of the mouse IL - 2R alpha gene using a thymic lymphoma - derived hybridoma ( PC60 ) . IL - 1 induces a rapid , protein synthesis - independent appearance of IL - 2R alpha mRNA that is blocked by inhibitors of NF - kappa B activation . This segment functions as an IL - 2 - inducible enhancer and lies within a region that becomes DNase I hypersensitive in normal T cells in which IL - 2R alpha expression has been induced . IL - 2 responsiveness requires three distinct elements within the enhancer . Two of these are potential binding sites for STAT proteins . Hematopoietic lineage commitment : role of transcription factors . This review focuses on the roles of transcription factors in hematopoietic lineage commitment . A brief introduction to lineage commitment and asymmetric cell division is followed by a discussion of several methods used to identify transcription factors important in specifying hematopoietic cell types . Next is presented a discussion of the use of embryonic stem cells in the analysis of hematopoietic gene expression and the use of targeted gene disruption to analyze the role of transcription factors in hematopoiesis . Finally , the status of our current knowledge concerning the roles of transcription factors in the commitment to erythroid , myeloid and lymphoid cell types is summarized . Epstein - Barr virus replicative gene transcription during de novo infection of human thymocytes : simultaneous early expression of BZLF - 1 and its repressor RAZ . We and others have shown that EBV can also infect a subset of thymocytes . Infection of thymocytes was accompanied by the appearance of linear EBV genome within 8 hr of infection . Circularization of the EBV genome was not detected . This is in contrast to the infection in B cells where the genome can circularize within 24 hr of infection . The appearance of a novel fusion transcript ( RAZ ) , which comprised regions of the BZLF - 1 locus and the adjacent BRLF - 1 locus , was detected by RT - PCR . ZEBRA protein was also identified in infected thymocytes by immunoprecipitation . In addition , we demonstrated that the EBNA - 1 gene in infected thymocytes was transcribed from the Fp promoter , rather than from the Cp / Wp promoter which is used in latently infected B cells . These observations suggest that de novo EBV infection of thymocytes differs from infection of B cells . Identification and purification of human Stat proteins activated in response to interleukin - 2 . A key cytokine induced during the immune response is IL - 2 . Following T cell activation , the genes encoding IL - 2 and the various chains of its receptor are transcriptionally induced . In turn , secreted IL - 2 serves to stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of T lymphocytes . Following this lead , we set out to identify transcription factors induced in response to IL - 2 . Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were observed to contain several IL - 2 - inducible DNA binding activities . Similar activities were also observed in a transformed human lymphocyte line , termed YT . We have purified these activities and found that the principal IL - 2 - inducible component bears significant relatedness to a prolactin - induced transcription factor first identified in sheep mammary gland tissue . We hypothesize that activation of this protein , designated hStat5 , helps govern the biological effects of IL - 2 during the immune response . E2F - 1 and a cyclin - like DNA repair enzyme , uracil - DNA glycosylase , provide evidence for an autoregulatory mechanism for transcription . The cell cycle - dependent transcription factor , E2F - 1 , regulates the cyclin - like species of the DNA repair enzyme uracil - DNA glycosylase ( UDG ) gene in human osteosarcoma ( Saos - 2 ) cells . The major putative downstream site for E2F , located in the first exon , serves as a target for E2F - 1 / DP1 complex binding in vitro . We also provide evidence for the functional relationship between the cyclin - like UDG gene product and E2F . High levels of UDG expression in a transient transfection assay result in the down - regulation of transcriptional activity through elements specific for E2F - mediated transcription . This hypothetical model integrates one mechanism of DNA repair with the cell cycle control of gene transcription , likely through E2F . This implicates E2F as a multifunctional target for proteins and enzymes , possibly , responsive to DNA damage through the negative effect of UDG on E2F - mediated transcriptional activity . Interferon - gamma ( IFN - gamma ) is an important immunoregulatory protein produced predominantly by T cells and large granular lymphocytes ( LGL ) in response to different extracellular signals . In particular , two interleukins ( ILs ) , IL - 2 and IL - 12 , have been shown to be potent inducers of IFN - gamma gene expression in both T cells and LGL . Although it has been reported that there are some T cell lines that produce IFN - gamma in response to IL - 2 and IL - 12 stimulation , there has as yet been no report of a natural killer ( NK ) cell line that responds in a similar manner . In this report we present evidence that the cell line NK3 . 3 derived from human NK cells , responds to both IL - 2 and IL - 12 , as measured by increases in IFN - gamma and granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) cytoplasmic mRNA and protein expression . The results suggest that activation of protein kinase C , but not new protein synthesis , is required for IL - 2 induction of IFN - gamma and GM - CSF cytoplasmic mRNA . In contrast , IL - 12 induction of IFN - gamma cytoplasmic mRNA appears to only partially depend on activation of protein kinase C . Furthermore , both transforming growth factor - beta and genistein , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor , could suppress IL - 2 and IL - 12 signaling but CsA was generally inactive . It also was observed that suppression of cytokine gene expression by these agents was independent of the inhibition of proliferation . These data indicate that IL - 2 and IL - 12 may have distinct signaling pathways leading to the induction of IFN - gamma and GM - CSF gene expression , and that the NK3 . 3 cell line may serve as a novel model for dissecting the biochemical and molecular events involved in these pathways . A functional T - cell receptor signaling pathway is required for p95vav activity . Stimulation of the T - cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) induces activation of multiple tyrosine kinases , resulting in phosphorylation of numerous intracellular substrates . It contains a number of structural motifs , including Src homology 2 , Src homology 3 , and pleckstrin homology domains and a putative guanine nucleotide exchange domain . The role of p95vav in TCR - mediated signaling processes is unclear . Here , we show that overexpression of p95vav alone in Jurkat T cells leads to activation of the nuclear factors , including NFAT , involved in interleukin - 2 expression . In contrast , NFAT activation by a G - protein - coupled receptor is not modulated by p95vav overexpression , suggesting that the effect is specific to the TCR signaling pathways . Although removal of the first 67 amino acids of p95vav activates its transforming potential in NIH 3T3 cells , this region appears to be required for its function in T cells . We further demonstrate that the p95vav - induced NFAT activation is not mimicked by Ras activation , though its function is dependent upon Ras and Raf . To further dissect p95vav involvement in TCR signaling , we analyzed various Jurkat mutants deficient in TCR signaling function or TCR expression and showed that an intact TCR signaling pathway is required for p95vav to function . However , overexpression of p95vav does not appear to influence TCR - induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation or increases in cytoplasmic free calcium . Taken together , our data suggest that p95vav plays an important role at an yet unidentified proximal position in the TCR signaling cascade . Positive and negative regulation of granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor promoter activity by AML1 - related transcription factor , PEBP2 . The granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) gene promoter contains a consensus sequence for the polyomavirus enhancer binding - protein 2 ( PEBP2 ) transcription factor , which consists of alpha and beta subunits . There are at least two genes , alpha A and alpha B , encoding the alpha subunit . PEBP2 alpha A1 , alpha B1 , and alpha B2 proteins bound the PEBP2 site within the mouse GM - CSF promoter . PEBP2 alpha A1 and alpha B1 enhanced the expression of the GM - CSF promoter - driven reporter plasmid in unstimulated and 12 - O - tetradecanoylphorbol 13 - acetate / phytohemagglutinin - stimulated human Jurkat T cells . In contrast , the promoter activity was suppressed by alpha B2 . Coexpression of alpha B1 and alpha B2 showed that the promoter activity could be determined by the alpha B1 / alpha B2 ratio . Jurkat cell extract contained PEBP2 site - binding protein ( s ) that cross - reacted with antimouse alpha A1 antibodies . Northern blot analysis indicated the expression of human PEBP2 alpha A , alpha B ( AML1 ) , and beta genes in Jurkat cells . The augmentation of LPS responses by interferon gamma ( IFN - gamma ) , referred to as priming , is well established . However , the mechanism ( s ) by which priming occurs is poorly defined . Using tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) induction as a model , experiments were designed to analyse in detail the priming effect on the LPS response in human monocytes . Priming by IFN - gamma was primarily manifested at the level of TNF mRNA accumulation . IFN - gamma pre - treatment affected the magnitude rather than the sensitivity of the LPS response . Priming occurred after several hours of treatment , and the primed state was induced by either IFN - gamma or GM - CSF , but not M - CSF . Primed monocytes transcribed TNF mRNA at a higher rate than freshly isolated monocytes upon activation with LPS . An additional significant finding was than TNF mRNA induced in primed cells was much more stable than in unprimed cells ( T1 / 2 increased 6 - 8 - fold ) . Finally , primed and unprimed cells possessed a differential sensitivity to the kinase inhibitor H - 89 . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) The CD4 promoter plays an important role in the developmental control of CD4 transcription . In this report , we show that the minimal CD4 promoter has four factor binding sites , each of which is required for full function . Using biochemical and mutagenesis analyses , we determined that multiple nuclear factors bind to these independent sites . We determined that an initiator - like sequence present at the cap site and an Ets consensus sequence are required for full promoter function . We also demonstrate that the Myc - associated zinc finger protein ( MAZ ) appears to be the predominant factor binding to one of these sites . This last site closely resembles the ME1a1 G3AG4AG3 motif previously shown to be a critical element in the P2 promoter of the c - myc gene . We therefore believe that the MAZ transcription factor is also likely to play an important role in the control of developmental expression of the CD4 gene . Erythropoietin stimulates transcription of the TAL1 / SCL gene and phosphorylation of its protein products . Activation of the TAL1 ( or SCL ) gene , originally identified through its involvement by a recurrent chromosomal translocation , is the most frequent molecular lesion recognized in T - cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia . The protein products of this gene contain the basic - helix - loop - helix motif characteristic of a large family of transcription factors that bind to the canonical DNA sequence CANNTG as protein heterodimers . TAL1 expression by erythroid cells in vivo and in chemical - induced erythroleukemia cell lines in vivo suggested the gene might regulate aspects of erythroid differentiation . Epo elicited a rapid , dose - related increase in TAL1 mRNA by increasing transcription of the gene and stabilizing one of its mRNAs . An Epo - inducible TAL1 DNA binding activity was identified in FVA cell nuclear extracts that subsequently decayed despite accumulating mRNA and protein . Induction of DNA binding activity was associated temporally with Epo - induced phosphorylation of nuclear TAL1 protein . These results indicate that Epo acts at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels on the TAL1 locus in Friend virus - induced erythroblasts and establish a link between Epo signaling mechanisms and a member of a family of transcription factors involved in the differentiation of diverse cell lineages . Nonradioactive quantification of glucocorticoid receptor expression during differentiation of human monocytic cells ( U937 ) . We describe a method for relative quantification of specific mRNA using a nonradioactive assay based on DNA strand competition between identical sequences of biotin - and fluorescein - labeled amplicon ( probe ) and unlabeled amplicon ( target ) during hybridization . As the target quantity increased , that of the double - labeled probe decreased in accordance with the mass action law . This technique was successfully applied to evaluate differences in glucocorticoid receptor expression in U937 cells before and after the addition of potent differentiation inducers : 12 - O - tetradecanoylphorbol 13 - acetate ( TPA ) and a combination of all - trans retinoic acid ( RA ) and 1 , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D2 ( VD ) . We observed that TPA treatment was associated with an increase in specific binding of [ 3H ] dexamethasone and up - regulation of GR mRNA while no enhanced GR expression was perceived with RA / VD treatment . Induction of Sp1 phosphorylation and NF - kappa B - independent HIV promoter domain activity in T lymphocytes stimulated by okadaic acid . In contrast to the purely enhancer - dependent effect of cytokines such as TNF on the activity of the HIV regulatory region ( LTR ) , we observed that okadaic acid ( OKA ) activates HIV transcription through both the enhancer , responding to the factor NF - kappa B , and the promoter domain of the LTR . The inducibility of HIV LTR - driven luciferase expression constructs in lymphoblastoid cells stimulated by OKA depended on both functional Sp1 binding elements and the ability of the TATA box to bind the protein TBP . In both transformed and normal lymphocytes , OKA stimulation induced intense phosphorylation of the constitutively expressed Sp1 protein in the nucleus , a property of OKA not shared by TNF , phorbol ester , or PHA and interleukin 2 . Responsiveness of LTR constructs deleted of kappa B elements to HIV Tat expression was increased upon OKA but not TNF stimulation . Our results suggest that SP1 phosphorylation induced by OKA , a selective inhibitor of the serine - threonine phosphatase PP2A , facilitates the formation of a transcription complex involving general transcription factors , HIV Tat , and Sp1 proteins . The formation of this complex would increase , independently of an in synergy with NF - kappa B , the low basal activity of the HIV LTR observed in normal T lymphocytes . To understand the molecular bases for cytokine redundancy and pleiotropy , we have compared the Stat proteins activated in peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBLs ) by cytokines with shared and distinct actions . Interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) rapidly activated Stat5 in fresh PBL , and Stat3 and Stat5 in preactivated PBL . IL - 7 and IL - 15 induced the same complexes as IL - 2 , a feature explained by the existence of similar tyrosine - phosphorylated motifs in the cytoplasmic domains of IL - 2R beta and IL - 7R that can serve as docking sites for Stat proteins . These studies demonstrate that a single cytokine can activate different combinations of Stat proteins under different physiological conditions , and also indicate two mechanisms by which distinct cytokines can activate the same Stat protein . I kappa B - alpha inhibits transcription factor NF - kappa B by retaining it in the cytoplasm . Various stimuli , typically those associated with stress or pathogens , rapidly inactivate I kappa B - alpha . This liberates NF - kappa B to translocate to the nucleus and initiate transcription of genes important for the defense of the organism . Activation of NF - kappa B correlates with phosphorylation of I kappa B - alpha and requires the proteolysis of this inhibitor . These results suggest that phosphorylation at one or both of these residues is critical for activation of NF - kappa B . We used deletion analysis and transfection assays with reporter gene constructs to examine the transcription control elements in the 5 ' flanking region of the human EpoR gene . In erythroid cells most of the transcription activity was contained in a 150 bp promoter fragment with binding sites for transcription factors AP2 , Sp1 and the erythroid - specific GATA - 1 . The 150 bp hEpoR promoter exhibited high and low activity in erythroid OCIM1 and K562 cells , respectively , reflecting the high and low levels of constitutive hEpoR expression . The GATA - 1 and Sp1 binding sites in this promoter lacking a TATA sequence were necessary for a high level of transcription activation . Protein - DNA binding studies suggested that Sp1 and two other CCGCCC binding proteins from erythroid and non - erythroid cells could bind to the Sp1 binding motif . By increasing GATA - 1 levels via co - transfection , we were able to transactivate the hEpoR promoter in K562 cells and non - erythroid cells , but not in the highly active OCIM1 cells , although GATA - 1 mRNA levels were comparable in OCIM1 and K562 . Rather , hEpoR transcription activity depends on coordination between Sp1 and GATA - 1 with other cell - specific factors , including possibly other Sp1 - like binding proteins , to provide high level , tissue - specific expression . Overexpression of DR - nm23 , a protein encoded by a member of the nm23 gene family , inhibits granulocyte differentiation and induces apoptosis in 32Dc13 myeloid cells . Chronic myelogenous leukemia evolves in two clinically distinct stages : a chronic and a blast crisis phase . The molecular changes associated with chronic phase to blast crisis transition are largely unknown . We have identified a cDNA clone , DR - nm23 , differentially expressed in a blast - crisis cDNA library , which has approximately 70 % sequence similarity to the putative metastatic suppressor genes , nm23 - H1 and nm23 - H2 . DR - nm23 mRNA is preferentially expressed at early stages of myeloid differentiation of highly purified CD34 + cells . Its constitutive expression in the myeloid precursor 32Dc13 cell line , which is growth - factor dependent for both proliferation and differentiation , results in inhibition of granulocytic differentiation induced by granulocyte colony - stimulating factor and causes apoptotic cell death . These results are consistent with a role for DR - nm23 in normal hematopoiesis and raise the possibility that its overexpression contributes to differentiation arrest , a feature of blastic transformation in chronic myelogenous leukemia . An interferon - gamma activation sequence mediates the transcriptional regulation of the IgG Fc receptor type IC gene by interferon - gamma . Expression of the IgG Fc receptor type I ( Fc gamma RI ) on myeloid cells is dramatically increased by treatment with interferon - gamma ( IFN - gamma ) . We observed that Fc gamma RI transcript levels in monoblast - like U937 cells were elevated within 3 hr and peaked 12 hr after exposure to IFN - gamma . Nuclear run - on analysis revealed that the rate of Fc gamma RI transcription was increased by IFN - gamma . Transient transfections of CAT reporter gene constructs containing various Fc gamma RIC promoter sequences into U937 cells revealed that a 20 - bp region surrounding the transcription start site ( - 7 to + 13 ) was capable of mediating transcription initiation and that an IFN - gamma responsive element ( GIRE ) was present within 74 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site . A 17 - bp sequence between positions - 51 and - 35 conferred IFN - gamma responsiveness on a heterologous promoter . Gel shift experiments further showed that the STAT1 alpha protein bound to the Fc gamma RIC GIRE in response to IFN - gamma treatment of U937 cells . Our results demonstrate that transcriptional regulation of the Fc gamma RIC gene by IFN - gamma involves the binding of STAT1 alpha to a 17 - bp GAS homology in the proximal promoter . Constitutively activated Jak - STAT pathway in T cells transformed with HTLV - I . Human T cell lymphotropic virus I ( HTLV - I ) is the etiological agent for adult T cell leukemia and tropical spastic paraparesis ( also termed HTLV - I - associated myelopathy ) . HTLV - I - infected peripheral blood T cells exhibit an initial phase of interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) - dependent growth ; over time , by an unknown mechanism , the cells become IL - 2 - independent . Whereas the Jak kinases Jak1 and Jak3 and the signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins Stat3 and Stat5 are activated in normal T cells in response to IL - 2 , this signaling pathway was constitutively activated in HTLV - I - transformed cells . Nitric oxide decreases cytokine - induced endothelial activation . To test the hypothesis that nitric oxide ( NO ) limits endothelial activation , we treated cytokine - stimulated human saphenous vein endothelial cells with several NO donors and assessed their effects on the inducible expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( VCAM - 1 ) . This inhibition was paralleled by reduced monocyte adhesion to endothelial monolayers in nonstatic assays , was unaffected by cGMP analogues , and was quantitatively similar after stimulation by either IL - 1 alpha , IL - 1 beta , IL - 4 , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF alpha ) , or bacterial lipopolysaccharide . NO also decreased the endothelial expression of other leukocyte adhesion molecules ( E - selectin and to a lesser extent , intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 ) and secretable cytokines ( IL - 6 and IL - 8 ) . Nuclear run - on assays , transfection studies using various VCAM - 1 promoter reporter gene constructs , and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that NO represses VCAM - 1 gene transcription , in part , by inhibiting NF - kappa B . We propose that NO ' s ability to limit endothelial activation and inhibit monocyte adhesion may contribute to some of its antiatherogenic and antiinflammatory properties within the vessel wall . MIP1 alpha nuclear protein ( MNP ) , a novel transcription factor expressed in hematopoietic cells that is crucial for transcription of the human MIP - 1 alpha gene . Secreted from activated T cells and macrophages , bone marrow - derived MIP - 1 alpha / GOS19 inhibits primitive hematopoietic stem cells and appears to be involved in the homeostatic control of stem cell proliferation . Therefore , it is important to understand the mechanisms which control the expression of MIP - 1 alpha / GOS19 . Previous work has shown that in Jurkat T cells , a set of widely expressed transcription factors ( the ICK - 1 family ) affect the GOS19 promoter . In this communication , we provide evidence that the pathway of induction in the macrophage cell line U937 is different from that in Jurkat cells . Furthermore , we show that the ICK - 1 binding site does not confer negative regulation in U937 cells . Interaction of nuclear extracts from various cell lines and tissue with the MNP site leads to the formation of fast - migrating protein - DNA complexes with similar but distinct electrophoretic mobilities . A mutation of the MNP site which does not abrogate ICK - 1 binding inactivates the GOS19 . 1 promoter in U937 cells and reduces its activity by fourfold in Jurkat cells . We propose that the MNP protein ( s ) binding at the MNP site constitutes a novel transcription factor ( s ) expressed in hematopoietic cells . The effect of Toremifene on the expression of some genes in human mononuclear cells . Toremifene exerts multiple and varied effects on the gene expression of human peripheral mononuclear cells . After short - term , in vitro exposure to therapeutical levels , distinct changes in P - glycoprotein , steroid receptors , p53 and Bcl - 2 expression take place . In view of the increasing use of antiestrogens in cancer therapy and prevention , there is obvious merit in long - term in vivo studies to be conducted . The interleukin - 5 / receptor interaction activates Lyn and Jak2 tyrosine kinases and propagates signals via the Ras - Raf - 1 - MAP kinase and the Jak - STAT pathways in eosinophils . We have shown that the interaction of interleukin ( IL ) - 5 with the receptor activates Lyn tyrosine kinase within 1 min and Jak2 tyrosine kinase within 1 - 3 min . IL - 5 also stimulates GTP binding to p21ras . Jak2 kinase has been shown to phosphorylate STAT nuclear proteins . The activation of STAT nuclear factors was studied by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a gamma activation site ( GAS ) probe . We found that IL - 5 induces two GAS - binding proteins in eosinophils , one of which is STAT1 . The IE2 gene product of human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) is one of a few viral regulatory proteins expressed immediately upon infection of the host cell . It is a potent transcriptional activator of many viral and cellular promoters . However , unlike another tumor suppressor protein , p53 , Rb did not have any significant effect on basal levels of transcription , suggesting that Rb specifically interacts with IE2 rather than other cellular factors involved in the general transcription machinery . We found by protein - affinity chromatography that Rb in nuclear extracts or produced by in vitro translation directly bound to IE2 . Our results suggest that Rb may regulate the life cycle of HCMV , which is endemic in the human population . Furthermore , these data may provide new insights into the slow rate of HCMV DNA replication in cells and the possible involvement of HCMV in tumorigenesis . Expression of the nucleoside diphosphate kinase in human skin cancers : an immunohistochemical study . Expression of nucleoside diphosphate ( NDP ) kinase , which is homologous to the nm23 gene product in a variety of species , has been found to be inversely associated with metastatic potential . In order to determine whether NDP kinase expression serves as a marker for metastatic potential in human skin cancer , we assessed the levels of NDP kinase expression in 9 keratoacanthomas ( KAs ) , 26 squamous cell carcinomas ( SCCs ) , and 25 basal cell carcinomas ( BCCs ) using immunohistochemistry . The expression of NDP kinase was intense in KA and SCC compared with BCC . However , the difference of NDP kinase expression between KA and SCC was not statistically significant . Our results contradict the hypothesis concerning the possible role of nm23 gene as a metastatic suppressor gene in human skin cancer . The mechanism of overexpression in various tumor cell types and its biological significance in cutaneous carcinogenesis remain to be determined . RB and a novel E2F - 1 binding protein in MHC class II deficient B - cell lines and normal IFN - gamma induction of the class IL transactivator CIITA in class II non - inducible RB - defective tumor lines . The major histocompatibility ( MHC ) class II genes encode cell surface proteins that bind antigenic peptide for presentation to T - cells . The class II proteins are expressed constitutively on B - cells and EBV - transformed B - cells , and are inducible by IFN - gamma on a wide variety of cell types . Therefore , we examined the RB status of a series of B - cell mutants that are defective in class II expression , generated either in vitro or derived from Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome ( BLS ) patients . Nuclear matrix - bound RB was detectable in all cases , indicating that loss of RB is not responsible for decreased class II expression in these lines . A second E2F - I binding protein , most likely DP - I , was also apparently normal in both class II - positive and - negative B - cell lines . CIITA is a class II gene transactivator known to be defective in one form of BLS and to be required for the induction of MHC class II by IFN - gamma . CIITA mRNA is normally inducible by IFN - gamma in class II non - inducible , RB - defective lines , and in one line , re - expression of RB has no effect on CIITA mRNA induction levels . Thus , the block in MHC class II inducibility in RB - defective cells is not due to a block in CIITA inducibility . Interleukin 12 induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STAT4 in human lymphocytes . Interleukin 12 ( IL - 12 ) is an important immunoregulatory cytokine whose receptor is a member of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily . Recently , transcription factors known as STATs ( signal transducers and activators of transcription ) have been shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated and activated in response to a number of cytokines that bind hematopoietin receptors and activate JAK kinases . In this report we demonstrate that IL - 12 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of a recently identified STAT family member , STAT4 , and show that STAT4 expression is regulated by T - cell activation . These data , and the recent demonstration of JAK phosphorylation by IL - 12 , identify a rapid signal - transduction pathway likely to mediate IL - 12 - induced gene expression . Temperature - induced down - regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor in peripheral blood mononuclear leucocyte in patients with sepsis or septic shock . OBJECTIVE : Activation of the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal axis is of vital importance during critical illness . We have studied the adaptive mechanisms which occur at the level of the glucocorticoid receptor in glucocorticoid target tissues in patients with sepsis or septic shock . SUBJECTS : Fifteen patients ( age 25 - 79 ) with sepsis or septic shock who were admitted to an intensive care unit were studied . The control group consisted of 24 healthy laboratory employees . MEASUREMENTS : The binding capacity and affinity of the glucocorticoid receptors were measured and compared to clinical data and the plasma cortisol concentrations . In vitro , hyperthermia as well as variations in the cellular composition did not influence the glucocorticoid receptor . In vivo , there was no change in the number of receptors per cell in patients with sepsis or septic shock as compared to healthy controls . However , a decreased affinity of the glucocorticoid receptor was observed . There was a weak but significant negative correlation between body temperature and the number of glucocorticoid receptors in the patient group . There was no relation between circulating cortisol concentrations and glucocorticoid receptor affinity and number . CONCLUSIONS : There is no obvious regulation of the number of glucocorticoid receptors by plasma cortisol concentrations in vivo . The decreased affinity of the glucocorticoid receptor together with the negative correlation between hyperthermia and the number of glucocorticoid receptors in patients with sepsis or septic shock suggest that hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal axis activation during critical illness is accompanied by peripheral adaptation in glucocorticoid receptor number and affinity . A possible signaling role for the Syk tyrosine kinase . Activation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases is an important aspect of signal transduction mediated by integrins . In the human monocytic cell line THP - 1 , either integrin - dependent cell adhesion to fibronectin or ligation of beta 1 integrins with antibodies causes a rapid and intense tyrosine phosphorylation of two sets of proteins of about 65 - 75 and 120 - 125 kDa . In addition , integrin ligation leads to nuclear translocation of the p50 and p65 subunits of the NF - kappa B transcription factor , to activation of a reporter gene driven by a promoter containing NF - kappa B sites , and to increased levels of mRNAs for immediate - early genes , including the cytokine interleukin ( IL ) - 1 beta . The components tyrosine phosphorylated subsequent to cell adhesion include paxillin , pp125FAK , and the SH2 domain containing tyrosine kinase Syk . In contrast , integrin ligation with antibodies induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk but not of FAK or paxillin . In adhering cells , pre - treatment with cytochalasin D suppresses tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin but not of Syk , while IL - 1 beta message induction is unaffected . Inhibition of dexamethasone binding to human glucocorticoid receptor by New World primate cell extracts . B95 - 8 cytosol inhibited specific binding of [ 3H ] dexamethasone ( P < 0 . 01 ) when mixed with cytosol prepared from either a human lymphoid cell line ( HL ) or rat thymus . The inhibitory activity was heat labile and trypsin sensitive . Peak inhibitory activity was found in the 150 - 200 kd fractions after Sephacryl G - 200 ultrafiltration . Scatchard analysis of [ 3H ] dexamethasone binding using mixed cytosol showed a diminished GR apparent binding affinity when compared to HL cytosol . These data demonstrate that B95 - 8 cells contain a competitive inhibitor that prevents binding of dexamethasone to its cognate receptor . Disruption of a GATA motif in the Duffy gene promoter abolishes erythroid gene expression in Duffy - negative individuals . The mRNA for the Duffy blood group antigen , the erythrocyte receptor for the Plasmodium vivax malaria parasite , has recently been cloned and shown to encode a widely expressed chemokine receptor . Here , we show that the Duffy antigen / chemokine receptor gene ( DARC ) is composed of a single exon and that most Duffy - negative blacks carry a silent FY * B allele with a single T to C substitution at nucleotide - 46 . This mutation impairs the promoter activity in erythroid cells by disrupting a binding site for the GATA1 erythroid transcription factor . With the recent characterization of the FY * A and FY * B alleles , these findings provide the molecular basis of the Duffy blood group system and an explanation for the erythroid - specific repression of the DARC gene in Duffy - negative individuals . Activation of pp90rsk and early growth response - 1 gene expression by pokeweed mitogen in human B cells . The present studies have examined the effects of pokeweed mitogen ( PWM ) on the induction of early growth response - 1 gene ( EGR - 1 ) in normal human B cells . PWM regulates EGR - 1 gene expression by both transcriptional and post - transcriptional mechanisms . Transient transfection assays with EGR - 1 promoter fragments linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene demonstrated that PWM induced EGR - 1 transcription is conferred by the CArG motif ( C C [ AT ] 6GG ) in the EGR - 1 promoter . Taken together , these findings suggest that PWM is able to initiate an intracytoplasmic signalling cascade and EGR - 1 induction in normal human B cells . A conserved motif in the promoters of several cytokines expressed by human Th2 - type lymphocytes . It contains a core sequence CTTGG . . . CCAAG which is present as part of larger palindromic sequences in each gene . This suggest that they may interact with a new family of trans - acting factors . In DNA mobility shift assays , this sequence can give either six different specific bands which are competed out by different parts of the sequence or one specific band which is competed out by each of the inverted repeats , depending on the reconstitution conditions . Considering the strong positive regulatory effect of this element and its presence in several T - cell - expressed cytokine genes , it may be crucial to the coordinated expression of these cytokines in T helper cells . cDNA cloning of a NGFI - B / nur77 - related transcription factor from an apoptotic human T cell line . A human T lymphoid cell line , PEER , dies by apoptosis in the presence of PMA and calcium ionophore . A new gene , TINUR , was cloned from apoptotic PEER cells . The expression of the TINUR gene is induced within 1 h after the cross - linking of the T cell Ag receptor complex . TINUR belongs to the NGFI - B / nur77 family of the steroid receptor superfamily and is an orphan receptor . TINUR binds to the same DNA sequence as NGFI - B / nur77 . We also propose that the NGFI - B / nur77 family can be classified into two subtypes . BACKGROUND : The induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( VCAM - 1 ) and E - selectin by tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF ) is mediated by mobilization of the transcription factor nuclear factor - kappa B ( NF - kappa B ) . Since salicylates have been reported to inhibit NF - kappa B activation by preventing the degradation of its inhibitor I kappa B , we studied a potential inhibition of this pathway by acetylsalicylate ( aspirin ) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) . METHODS AND RESULTS : Gel - shift analyses demonstrated dose - dependent inhibition of TNF - induced NF - kappa B mobilization by aspirin at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mmol / L . Induction of VCAM - 1 and E - selectin surface expression by TNF was dose - dependently reduced by aspirin over the same range , while induction of intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 ( ICAM - 1 ) was hardly affected . Aspirin appeared to prevent VCAM - 1 transcription , since it dose - dependently inhibited induction of VCAM - 1 mRNA by TNF . As a functional consequence , adhesion of U937 monocytes to TNF - stimulated HUVECs was markedly reduced by aspirin due to suppression of VCAM - 1 and E - selectin upregulation . CONCLUSIONS : Our data suggest that aspirin inhibits NF - kappa B mobilization , induction of VCAM - 1 and E - selectin , and subsequent monocyte adhesion in endothelial cells stimulated by TNF , thereby providing an additional mechanism for therapeutic effects of aspirin . Activation of NF - kappa B by phosphatase inhibitors involves the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha at phosphatase 2A - sensitive sites . In the present study , the role of serine / threonine phosphatases in the regulation of I kappa B alpha phosphorylation was investigated . Our studies demonstrate that incubation of human T cells with low concentrations ( approximately 1 - 5 nM ) of calyculin A or okadaic acid , potent inhibitors of protein phosphatase type 1 ( PP - 1 ) and type 2A ( PP - 2A ) , induces the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha even in the absence of any cellular stimulus . This action of the phosphatase inhibitors , which is associated with the activation of the RelA . p50 NF - kappa B heterodimer , is not affected by agents that block the induction of I kappa B alpha phosphorylation by tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - alpha ) . Furthermore , the phosphorylated I kappa B alpha from calyculin A - treated cells , but not that from TNF - alpha - stimulated cells , is sensitive to PP - 2A in vitro , suggesting the existence of fundamental differences in the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha induced by the two different NF - kappa B inducers . However , induction of I kappa B alpha phosphorylation by both TNF - alpha and the phosphatase inhibitors is associated with the subsequent degradation of I kappa B alpha . We further demonstrate that TNF - alpha - and calyculin A - induced I kappa B alpha degradation exhibits similar but not identical sensitivities to a proteasome inhibitor . Sp1 functions in a chromatin - dependent manner to augment human alpha - globin promoter activity . We investigated the role of this G + C - rich region in augmenting alpha - globin promoter activity in the presence of the far - upstream alpha - globin enhancer , HS - 40 . We show that in transiently transfected erythroid cells , deletion of the alpha - globin G + C - rich 5 ' flanking region has no effect on alpha - globin promoter activity . However , upon stable integration into chromatin , deletion of this region causes a nearly 90 % decrease in promoter activity compared with expression from an alpha - globin promoter retaining this region . These results suggest that the alpha - globin G + C - rich 5 ' flanking region augments alpha - globin promoter activity in a chromatin - dependent manner . We further show that this G + C - rich region is required for the activation of alpha - globin gene expression during erythroid differentiation . Costimulation of human CD4 + T cells with LFA - 3 and B7 induce distinct effects on AP - 1 and NF - kappa B transcription factors . We have earlier shown that stimulation of human CD4 + T cells with SEA presented on Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) - DR transfectants coexpressing either B7 or LFA - 3 resulted in distinct cytokine profiles . We now demonstrate that B7 , but not LFA - 3 , strongly costimulated IL - 2 transcription and mRNA expression in CD4 + T cells . Maximal increase in IL - 2 transcription was recorded with CHO - DR / B7 / LFA - 3 , suggesting a cooperative effect of B7 and LFA - 3 at the transcriptional level . Gel - shift analysis demonstrated that stimulation of CD4 + T cells with CHO - DR and staphylococcal enterotoxin A was sufficient to induce significant amounts of NF - kappa B binding proteins , whereas induction of AP - 1 binding proteins required costimulation . The CHO - DR / B7 / LFA - 3 triple transfectant induced a further increase in AP - 1 and NF - kappa B binding proteins compared with the double transfectants . The level of Oct - 1 binding proteins remained similar in all samples . Super - shift analysis revealed that the NF - kappa B complex of costimulated CD4 + T cells contained large amounts of p50 , substantial amounts of p65 , and marginal levels of c - Rel proteins . The AP - 1 binding proteins contained c - Jun , Jun - D , and Fra - 1 , but marginal amounts of Jun - B and c - Fos . Our results indicate distinct effects of B7 and LFA - 3 costimulation on the activity of AP - 1 and NF - kappa B . These may partly account for the differential effects of B7 and LFA - 3 costimulation on IL - 2 expression . 2 , 3 , 7 , 8 - tetrachlorodibenzo - p - dioxin ( TCDD ) inhibits murine and human B lymphocyte immunoglobulin production through an unknown mechanism . This study investigated the effect of TCDD on expression of the CD19 gene in a human B lymphocyte cell line . Northern blot analysis showed that TCDD treatment decreased steady state levels of CD19 mRNA by 67 % in the IM - 9 cell line . Using a gel mobility shift assay , we identified a DNA - binding complex in IM - 9 nuclear extracts that by several criteria appears to be the Ah receptor . These results suggest that the AhR could interfere with BSAP - stimulated CD19 gene transcription by competition for a common DNA binding site . Inhibitory action of nm23 proteins on induction of erythroid differentiation of human leukemia cells . nm23 genes encode proteins that participate in tumor metastasis regulation and in various fundamental cellular processes , although their mechanisms of action are still unknown . Although all nm23 proteins contain nucleoside diphosphate ( NDP ) kinase activity , it has not been established that the enzyme activity mediated the various functions of nm23 proteins . Native human erythrocyte NDP kinase protein inhibited the induction of erythroid differentiation of HEL , KU812 and K562 cells , but not the induction of monocytic or granulocytic differentiation of HL - 60 , U937 and HEL / S cells . The erythroid differentiation of HEL cells was inhibited by recombinant human nm23 - H1 , - H2 , mouse nm23 - M1 , and - M2 proteins . Moreover , both the mutant nm23 - H2His protein and truncated nm23 - H2 protein containing N - terminal ( 1 - 60 ) peptide , which do not have NDP kinase activity , also inhibited erythroid differentiation of HEL cells . These results suggest that ( 1 ) the differentiation inhibitory activity of I - factor / nm23 protein is not restricted to monocytic differentiation of M1 cells , ( 2 ) the inhibitory activity is exhibited without species specificity , and ( 3 ) the differentiation inhibitory activity of the nm23 / NDP kinase protein is independent of its enzyme activity and requires the presence of N - terminal peptides . Lipopolysaccharide - induced E - selectin expression requires continuous presence of LPS and is inhibited by bactericidal / permeability - increasing protein . Endothelial cells stimulated by LPS express E - selectin , which plays an important role in mediating neutrophil adhesion during inflammation . E - selectin is induced within 1 - 2 h , peaks at 4 - 6 h , and gradually returns to basal level by 24 h . rBPI21 , a recombinant N - terminal fragment of human bactericidal / permeability - increasing protein ( BPI ) , inhibited LPS - induced E - selectin expression when added at the same time as , and up to 6 h after , LPS . These results indicate that endothelial activation requires continuous presence of LPS , and rBPI21 acts to reverse LPS - mediated endothelial activation by interrupting the on - going LPS signal . So called costimulatory signals , mediated by other cell surface interactions or soluble cytokines produced by antigen presenting cells , are also required for complete T cell activation . High levels of cytokine gene expression in T cells also required both TCR and costimulatory signals . The granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor requires sequences in the promoter as well as a powerful enhancer located 3kb upstream to respond to TCR - like signals . These promoter and enhancer regions are mainly activated by the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) . The activation of NFAT by TCR signals has been well described for interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) and IL - 4 gene transcription in T cells . This region is termed the CK - 1 or CD28RE and appears to bind specific members of the NF - kappa B family of transcription factors . We have found that the HTLV - 1 transactivator protein , tax , acts as a costimulatory signal for GM - CSF and IL - 2 gene transcription , in that it can cooperate with TCR signals to mediate high level gene expression . Tax activates the GM - CSF promoter through the CK - 1 / CD28RE region and also activates nuclear factor - kappa B binding to this region . However , other transcription factors or coactivators of NF - kappa B are required for tax activation but these remain to be identified . The CK - 1 / CD28RE of GM - CSF shows a high degree of similarity to the IL - 2 CD28RE and the IL - 3 gene also contains a related region . Danazol decreases transcription of estrogen receptor gene in human monocytes . 1 . Administration of danazol for over one month reduced the levels of estrogen receptor ( ER ) and its mRNA to approximately 50 and 20 % , respectively in monocytes . 2 . Danazol did not alter the degradation rate of ER mRNA in monocytes . 4 . Danazol may release estrogen predominance via the reduction of transcription for ER gene , which leads to the reduction of ER mRNA and ER expressions in monocytes . Functional characterization of novel IL - 2 transcriptional inhibitors . IL - 2 - mediated T cell proliferation is a critical early event in the inflammatory process . Using a cell line that is stably transfected with a trimer of the NFAT - 1 regulatory element linked to a lac - Z reporter gene , we screened for inhibitors of NFAT - 1 - mediated beta - galactosidase activity . WIN 61058 and WIN 53071 were identified as microM inhibitors . These compounds also inhibited beta - galactosidase mRNA levels . Similar inhibition of NFAT - 1 - mediated gene expression was observed in a second cell line , which is stably transfected with NFAT - 1 regulatory elements linked to the reporter gene for sCD8 . At 10 microM , both compounds inhibited IL - 2 mRNA and protein levels in the NFAT - 1 - linked lac - Z transfectants , and in human lymphocytes . Both compounds inhibited the mixed lymphocyte reaction , and this inhibition was reversed by exogenous IL - 2 . Conversely , calcium - independent anti - CD28 Ab and PMA - induced IL - 2 production was resistant . Both compounds altered the NFAT - 1 transcriptional complex , causing its retarded mobility on gels . By these functional criteria , we believe we have identified two structurally distinct , novel inhibitors of NFAT - 1 - mediated transcription . Transcriptional regulation of the vacuolar H ( + ) - ATPase B2 subunit gene in differentiating THP - 1 cells . Monocyte - macrophage differentiation was used as a model system for studying gene regulation of the human vacuolar H ( + ) - ATPase ( V - ATPase ) . We have begun to examine the structure of the B2 subunit promoter region . Isolation and sequencing of the first exon and 5 ' - flanking region of this gene reveal a TATA - less promoter with a high G + C content . We found that sequences downstream from the transcriptional start site were sufficient to confer increased expression during THP - 1 differentiation . DNase I footprinting and sequence analysis revealed the existence of multiple AP2 and Sp1 binding sites in the 5 ' - untranslated and proximal coding regions . Synergy between signal transduction pathways is obligatory for expression of c - fos in B and T cell lines : implication for c - fos control via surface immunoglobulin and T cell antigen receptors . Expression of the protooncogene c - fos is controlled by three main regulatory pathways involving kinase C , cAMP , and calcium . Kinase C mediates its effects via phosphorylation of serum response factor ( SRF ) which interacts with the serum response element ( SRE ) ; cAMP and calcium mediate their effects via phosphorylation of CREB ( cAMP regulatory element binding protein ) presumably by activation of a protein kinase A or calmodulin - regulated kinase . We have found that stimulation of any one of these pathways alone has little or no effect on c - fos induction . However , kinase C activation ( PMA stimulation ) combined with either cAMP ( forskolin plus MIX ) or calcium stimulation ( ionophore ) leads to greatly enhanced c - fos induction . By contrast , cAMP in the presence of calcium shows no synergy in c - fos induction . Analysis of AP - 1 activity using gel mobility shift assays confirms that the requirements for synergy in c - fos mRNA induction are paralleled by requirements for synergy in induction of AP - 1 activity . Signaling in B cells due to anti - Ig stimulation involves both kinase C activation and release of intracellular calcium , and results in c - fos mRNA induction . Our results indicate that synergy between the kinase C activation and calcium is needed for efficient c - fos induction since neither of these two alone induces c - fos well . That synergy of signaling pathways is relevant for the anti - Ig induction of c - fos is supported by the fact that cAMP - inducing agents and okadaic acid further enhance anti - Ig induction of c - fos . The human granulocyte - macrophage CSF ( GM - CSF ) gene is expressed in T cells in response to TCR activation that can be mimicked by treatment of the cells with PMA and Ca2 + ionophore . The gene contains a proximal functional promoter region ( - 620 to + 34 ) , as well as a powerful enhancer located 3 kb upstream , both of which are involved in the response of the gene to TCR activation . The proximal promoter contains a region termed CLEO ( - 54 to - 31 ) that consists of a purine - rich element abutting an activator protein - 1 ( AP - 1 ) - like site , as well as an upstream nuclear factor - kappa B ( NF - kappa B ) site ( - 85 to - 76 ) and a CK - 1 element ( - 101 to - 92 ) . We show in this work that mutations in either the purine - rich region of the CLEO element or the NF - kappa B site result in reduced PMA / Ca2 + activation of a 620 - bp human GM - CSF promoter - luciferase reporter construct in Jurkat T cells by 65 % and 50 % , respectively . The major inducible protein complex that binds to the human CLEO ( hCLEO ) element is an AP - 1 - like complex that is inducible by PMA alone , but shows increased binding in response to PMA together with Ca2 + ionophore . Although the binding of this complex is not cyclosporin - sensitive , promoter induction is inhibited by cyclosporin treatment . A second weak inducible complex resembling nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF - AT ) was also observed binding to the hCLEO region . By using recombinant proteins , we confirmed that AP - 1 , NF - ATp , and a higher order NF - ATp / AP - 1 complex could all form with the hCLEO element , and we have also defined the sequence requirements for binding of each of these complexes . We found that expression of a constitutively active form of calcineurin could substitute for Ca2 + ionophore and synergize with PMA to activate the GM - CSF promoter , and conversely that mutant - activated Ras could substitute for PMA and cooperate with Ca2 + ionophore . Co - expression of Ras and calcineurin , however , did not activate the GM - CSF promoter , but required the additional expression of NF - kappa B p65 . IL - 10 induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of tyk2 and Jak1 and the differential assembly of STAT1 alpha and STAT3 complexes in human T cells and monocytes . IL - 10 affects monocytes and T cells by driving the progression of immune responsiveness such that Th2 lymphocyte - mediated effects predominate . Moreover , monocytes express a novel IL - 10 - stimulated STAT protein with an M ( r ) of 70 kDa that is recognized by the anti - STAT3 Ab but is not observed in T cells . Use of new biologic markers in the ovulation induction . Biological markers of ovulation , after a great in the past , have been fallen into disuse for the large diffusion of biochemical and biophysical ones . To explore the modifications of not reproductive target tissues as ovulation markers we studied the behaviour of Albuminemia , Platelet Factor IV ( as indicator of Platelet Aggregation ) , Type II estrogenic receptors in 42 ovulation induced women , undergoing our observation . 33 of them had ovulation and 9 developed a LUF syndrome , constituting two biological models of an opposite situation for the three markers observed . All the markers considered were sufficiently sensitive , but among them , Platelet Factor IV was the most reliable to the hormonal ovulatory situation . Abnormal regulation of the IL - 2 promoter in lpr CD4 - CD8 - T lymphocytes results in constitutive expression of a novel nuclear factor of activated T cells - binding factor . The inert quality of MRL - Ipr / Ipr ( Ipr ) peripheral CD4 - CD8 - ( CD4 - 8 - ) T cells manifests primarily as an inability to proliferate or produce IL - 2 in response to TCR or mitogenic stimulation . Yet these same cells do initiate early TCR - mediated signaling events , such as generation of inositol phosphates and increased intracellular calcium . We , therefore , compared the activation state of the IL - 2 gene promoter region in freshly isolated and stimulated Ipr CD4 - 8 - T cells with that of normal T lymphocytes . Upon stimulation with mitogens , formation of the transactivating complex , nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF - AT ) , occurs with normal kinetics in Ipr CD4 - 8 - T cells . Yet , the levels of the activating NF - AT complex never reach those observed in similarly stimulated normal T cells . Furthermore , nuclear extracts from Ipr CD4 - 8 - T cells display high levels of a novel specific binding activity at the NF - AT site , which is present at much lower levels in freshly isolated normal T lymphocytes . Upon mitogenic stimulation , the binding activity of the novel NF - AT - binding factor is rapidly down - regulated in normal T cells , but persists at high levels in Ipr CD4 - 8 - T cells . These two abnormalities at the NF - AT site provide a potential mechanism to account for the defect in IL - 2 production from Ipr CD4 - 8 - T cells . Cross - linking of CD30 induces HIV expression in chronically infected T cells . CD30 , a member of the tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) receptor family , is expressed constitutively on the surface of the human T cell line ACH - 2 , which is chronically infected with human immunodeficiency virus type - 1 ( HIV ) - 1 . CD30 cross - linking does not alter proliferation of ACH - 2 cells and the induction of HIV expression is not mediated by endogenous TNF alpha / beta . Furthermore , cross - linking of CD30 leads to NF - kappa B activation and enhanced HIV transcription . Thus , CD30 - CD30L interactions mediate the induction of HIV expression by a kappa B - dependent pathway that is independent of TNF . This mechanism may be important in the activation of HIV expression from latently infected CD4 + T cells , especially in lymphoid organs where cell to cell contact is conducive to receptor - ligand interactions . Human MHC class II gene transcription directed by the carboxyl terminus of CIITA , one of the defective genes in type II MHC combined immune deficiency . Four distinct complementation groups have been identified . Recently , the defective gene in group II type II MHC CID has been isolated and termed CIITA . The specificity of CIITA for three major MHC class II genes , DR , DQ and DP , is mediated by its remaining C - terminal residues ( amino acids 317 - 1130 ) . The transactivation of multiple cis elements , especially S and X2 , of the DR alpha proximal promoter in group II CID cells is CIITA dependent . Since CIITA overexpression in normal cells did not increase class II expression , we propose that initiation of CIITA expression serves as the on - off switch , while availability of downstream interactor ( s ) limits transcription . Monocyte tethering by P - selectin regulates monocyte chemotactic protein - 1 and tumor necrosis factor - alpha secretion . Signal integration and NF - kappa B translocation [ see comments ] Adhesion molecules that tether circulating leukocytes to endothelial cells may also transduce or modulate outside - in signals for cellular activation , providing an initial regulatory point in the inflammatory response . Adhesion of human monocytes to P - selectin , the most rapidly expressed endothelial tethering factor , increased the secretion of monocyte chemotactic protein - 1 ( MCP - 1 ) and tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF - alpha ) by the leukocytes when they were stimulated with platelet - activating factor . Increased cytokine secretion was specifically inhibited by G1 , an anti - P - selectin mAb that prevents P - selectin from binding to its ligand ( P - selectin glycoprotein ligand - 1 ) on myeloid cells . Moreover , tethering by P - selectin specifically enhanced nuclear translocation of nuclear factor - kappa B ( NF - kappa B ) , a transcription factor required for expression of MCP - 1 , TNF - alpha , and other immediate - early genes . Functional roles of in vivo footprinted DNA motifs within an alpha - globin enhancer . Erythroid lineage and developmental stage specificities . Transcriptional regulation of the human alpha - like globin genes , embryonic zeta 2 and adult alpha , during erythroid development is mediated by a distal enhancer , HS - 40 . Previous protein - DNA binding studies have shown that HS - 40 consists of multiple nuclear factor binding motifs that are occupied in vivo in an erythroid lineage - and developmental stage - specific manner . We have systematically analyzed the functional roles of these factor binding motifs of HS - 40 by site - directed mutagenesis and transient expression assay in erythroid cell cultures . Three of these HS - 40 enhancer motifs , 5 ' NF - E2 / AP1 , GT II , and GATA - 1 ( c ) , positively regulate the zeta 2 - globin promoter activity in embryonic / fetal erythroid K562 cells and the adult alpha - globin promoter activity in adult erythroid MEL cells . On the other hand , the 3 ' NF - E2 / AP1 motif is able to exert both positive and negative regulatory effects on the zeta 2 - globin promoter activity in K562 cells , and this dual function appears to be modulated through differential binding of the ubiquitous AP1 factors and the erythroid - enriched NF - E2 factor . Mutation in the GATA - 1 ( d ) motif , which exhibits an adult erythroid - specific genomic footprint , decreases the HS - 40 enhancer function in dimethyl sulfoxide - induced MEL cells but not in K562 cells . These studies have defined the regulatory roles of the different HS - 40 motifs . The remarkable correlation between genomic footprinting data and the mutagenesis results also suggests that the erythroid lineage - and developmental stage - specific regulation of human alpha - like globin promoters is indeed modulated by stable binding of specific nuclear factors in vivo . Nitric oxide - stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange on p21ras . The protooncogene p21ras , a monomeric G protein family member , plays a critical role in converting extracellular signals into intracellular biochemical events . The mechanism of activation is due to S - nitrosylation of a critical cysteine residue which stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange . Interleukin - 2 promoter activity in Epstein - Barr virus - transformed B lymphocytes is controlled by nuclear factor - chi B . The regulation of interleukin ( IL ) - 2 gene expression has been investigated mainly in T lymphocytes , the predominant producers of IL - 2 . However , B cells can also synthesize IL - 2 . An IL - 2 promoter bearing a defective NF - chi B site was completely inactive in EBV - transformed B cells , while it still had activity in Jurkat T cells . Similarly , a human immunodeficiency virus promoter , whose activity is controlled through chi B factors , was found to be active in the IL - 2 producing EBV - B cells , but inactive in the non - IL - 2 - producing cells . Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using protein extracts from EBV - B cells and the IL - 2 NF - chi B probe revealed the constitutive generation of chi B complexes in IL - 2 - secreting cells consisting mainly of heterodimeric p50 / p65 complexes . A weaker chi B complex formation and faster - migrating complexes were detected in non - IL - 2 - secreting cells . These results demonstrate that the IL - 2 NF - chi B site is indispensable for the activity of the IL - 2 promoter in EBV - transformed B cells , whereas other transcription factors appear to be less important for IL - 2 expression in these cells . The normal cell cycle is regulated by several molecules , such as the tumor - suppressor protein pRb , the G1 cyclins , the cyclin - dependent kinases , and their inhibitors . These regulators are targeted by negative growth regulatory signals , such as that provided by TGF - beta . Chemical cross - linking with 125I - labeled TGF - beta 1 showed an essentially normal TGF - beta receptor profile in EBV - positive and EBV - negative Burkitt ' s lymphoma cell lines , and these receptors were shown to be functional in transducing signals , as evidenced by the TGF - beta 1 - mediated modulation of junB gene expression . However , TGF - beta 1 did not induce dephosphorylation of pRb in EBV ( or LMP - 1 ) - positive cells as opposed to EBV - negative cells , suggesting a dichotomy in the TGF - beta 1 signaling pathway leading to separable gene regulatory and growth inhibitory responses . Furthermore , LMP - 1 was found to induce the expression of cyclin D2 ; normal B cells or EBV - negative Burkitt ' s lymphoma cells do not express D - type cyclins . Taken together , these data point to a potential mechanism underlying EBV - mediated B cell transformation whereby constitutive induction of key cell cycle regulators by LMP - 1 can lead to pRb hyperphosphorylation and uncontrolled cell proliferation . The effect of treatment on thyroid antibody production and T cell reactivity to thyroid antigens was studied in 15 patients with Graves ' disease ( GD ) before and after thyroidectomy , 19 patients with GD before and after radioactive iodine ( RAI ) therapy , and 9 patients maintained euthyroid on antithyroid drugs ( ATD ) . Twenty subjects matched for age and sex without known thyroid disease served as controls . In GD patients , the responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) and TSH receptor ( TSHR ) - specific T cell lines to recombinant human TSHR extracellular domain , thyroglobulin , and TSHR peptides were examined on the day of surgery or RAI therapy ( day 0 ) and also 6 - 8 weeks and 3 - 6 months thereafter . Reactivity to TSHR peptides before surgery was heterogeneous and spanned the entire extracellular domain . Six to 8 weeks after subtotal thyroidectomy , the number of patients ' PBMC responding to any peptide and the average number of recognized peptides decreased . The responses of PBMC from Graves ' patients before RAI therapy were less than those in the presurgical group . Three to 6 months after RAI , T cell responses to TSHR peptides were less than those 6 - 8 weeks after RAI therapy , but still higher than the values on day 0 . Responses of PBMC from patients with GD , maintained euthyroid on ATD , were lower than those before surgery or RAI therapy . The difference in the number of recognized peptides by patients ' PBMC before RAI and surgery may reflect the effect of long term therapy with ATD in the patients before RAI vs . the shorter period in patients before surgery . The decreased T cell reactivity to thyroid antigens after thyroidectomy could be the result of removal of a major part of the thyroid gland or redistribution of suppressor - inducer T cells . The increased T cell response after RAI therapy is probably epitope specific , rather than a response to the whole TSHR molecule . Synchronous recognition of peptides 158 - 176 and 248 - 263 is important for the development of GD , and the loss of recognition of one of these epitopes may be an early sign of immune remission and a predictor of euthyroidism . Circumvention of tolerance for the nuclear T cell protein TCF - 1 by immunization of TCF - 1 knock - out mice . Molecular events that underlie the well - defined phenotypic changes of the differentiating thymocyte are poorly understood . A candidate gene to control thymocyte differentiation , T cell factor - 1 ( TCF - 1 ) * encodes a DNA - binding protein . Its mRNA expression pattern is complex during embryogenesis , yet restricted to lymphocytes postnatally . Expression studies on TCF - 1 protein have been hampered by the difficulty to raise antibodies due to extreme evolutionary conservation . TCF - 1 knock - out mice , generated recently in our laboratory , have strongly decreased numbers of thymocytes , but are otherwise normal . We have used these mice to generate anti - TCF - 1 antibodies . By immunization with a recombinant fusion protein , we show that TCF - 1 knock - out mice readily yield antiserum titers against human and mouse TCF - 1 protein . Wild - type littermates remain unresponsive to TCF - 1 while they mount a high - titer antibody response to the fusion protein , Maltose Binding Protein ( MBP ) . Subsequently , TCF - 1 - specific hybridomas could be prepared from the spleens of immunized knock - out mice . This study illustrates the almost complete tolerance of mice for human TCF - 1 and demonstrates that this tolerance is readily broken by gene knock - out . Furthermore , the usefulness of knock - out mice for the generation of monoclonal antibodies against the gene product of interest is underscored . The transcription factor , Nm23H2 , binds to and activates the translocated c - myc allele in Burkitt ' s lymphoma . The PuF site on the silent normal c - myc allele was unoccupied . We demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay , electrophoretic mobility shift assay with antibody , UV cross - linking followed by SDS - gel electrophoresis , and Western analysis that Nm23H2 in B cell nuclear extracts bound to the c - myc PuF site . Access to this site is blocked in the normal silent c - myc allele ; these data suggest that the Nm23H2 protein is involved in deregulation of the translocated c - myc allele in Burkitt ' s lymphoma cells . Identification of two novel regulatory elements within the 5 ' - untranslated region of the human A gamma - globin gene . Interaction between the stage selector element ( SSE ) in the proximal gamma - globin promoter and hypersensitivity site 2 in the locus control region partly mediates the competitive silencing of the beta - globin promoter in the fetal developmental stage . We have now demonstrated that a second SSE - like element in the 5 ' - untranslated region of the gamma - gene also contributes to this competitive silencing of the beta - gene . Utilizing transient transfection assays in the fetal erythroid cell line , K562 , we have shown that the core enhancer of hypersensitivity site 2 can preferentially interact with the proximal gamma - promoter in the absence of the SSE , completely silencing a linked beta - promoter . Mutation of a 20 - base pair sequence of the gamma - gene 5 ' - untranslated region ( UTR ) led to derepression of beta - promoter activity . A marked activation of gamma - promoter activity was also observed with this mutation , suggesting the presence of a repressor . Fine mutagenesis dissected these activities to different regions of the 5 ' - UTR . The stage selector activity was localized to a region centered on nucleotides + 13 to + 15 . The repressor activity of the 5 ' - UTR was localized to tandem GATA - like sites , which appear to bind a complex of two proteins , one of which is the erythroid transcription factor GATA - 1 . Coupling of a signal response domain in I kappa B alpha to multiple pathways for NF - kappa B activation . The eukaryotic transcription factor NF - kappa B plays a central role in the induced expression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and in many aspects of the genetic program mediating normal T - cell activation and growth . The nuclear activity of NF - kappa B is tightly regulated from the cytoplasmic compartment by an inhibitory subunit called I kappa B alpha . This cytoplasmic inhibitor is rapidly phosphorylated and degraded in response to a diverse set of NF - kappa B - inducing agents , including T - cell mitogens , proinflammatory cytokines , and viral transactivators such as the Tax protein of human T - cell leukemia virus type 1 . To explore these I kappa B alpha - dependent mechanisms for NF - kappa B induction , we identified novel mutants of I kappa B alpha that uncouple its inhibitory and signal - transducing functions in human T lymphocytes . Specifically , removal of the N - terminal 36 amino acids of I kappa B alpha failed to disrupt its ability to form latent complexes with NF - kappa B in the cytoplasm . Growth regulation and cellular changes during differentiation of human prostatic cancer LNCaP cells as induced by T lymphocyte - conditioned medium . Addition of CM caused a greater than 70 % reduction of cell proliferation by cell counting and cell cycle . These cells showed G1 phase arrest and the clonogenicity was reduced . The growth - modulating effect was dose - dependent and not due to cell lysis or apoptosis . The binding of androgen to androgen receptor on these cells showed approximately 50 % reduction , underlining a proliferation reduction mechanism . The prostate - specific antigen ( PSA ) was downregulated to approximately 75 % during the process . The expression of several cytoskeleton and intracellular proteins increased as determined by immunostaining on slides and by ELISA procedures . From these cellular changes , we can infer that the cell growth was modulated along with induction of terminal differentiation . Activated T cells were demonstrated to be important in providing the modulating activity . This growth modulator was semipurified and had an estimated molecular weight 13 , 000 to 24 , 000 Da . The activity was determined to be distinct from TGF , TNF , and some commonly known lymphokines . The interaction between lymphoid and prostatic cells in growth and development is described . Platelet - activating factor stimulates transcription of the heparin - binding epidermal growth factor - like growth factor in monocytes . Correlation with an increased kappa B binding activity . The PAF - induced up - regulation of HB - EGF mRNA was accompanied by an increase in kappa B binding activity . Pretreatment of monocytes with pertussis toxin inhibited these functions of PAF , whereas cholera toxin had no inhibitory effect . Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate , an inhibitor for NF - kappa B activation , markedly reduced PAF - stimulated kappa B binding activity as well as up - regulation of HB - EGF mRNA . These results suggest a potential role of PAF in HB - EGF expression and provide evidence that this stimulation may occur through increased kappa B binding activity . Mapping of the interaction site of the defective transcription factor in the class II major histocompatibility complex mutant cell line clone - 13 to the divergent X2 - box . We have previously described a mutant B lymphoblastoid cell line , Clone - 13 , that expresses HLA - DQ in the absence of HLA - DR and - DP . Indeed , transient transfection of HLA - DRA and DQB reporter constructs indicated that the affected factor operates via cis - elements located between - 141 base pairs and the transcription initiation site . A series of hybrid DRA / DQB reporter constructs was generated to further map the relevant cis - elements in this system . Insertion of oligonucleotides spanning the DQB X - box ( but not the DQB - W region or the DQB Y - box ) upstream of - 141 in a DRA reporter plasmid rescued expression to nearly wild - type levels . Substitution promoters were then generated where the entire X - box , or only the X1 - or X2 - boxes of HLA - DRA were replaced with the analogous regions of HLA - DQB . None of the hybrid reporter constructs were defective when transfected into the wild - type , HLA - DR / - DQ positive parental cell line , Jijoye . These studies suggest that the divergent X2 - box of the class II major histocompatibility complex promoters plays an important role in influencing differential expression of the human class II isotypes . Restoration of the Epstein - Barr virus ZEBRA protein ' s capacity to disrupt latency by the addition of heterologous activation regions . The ZEBRA protein has a unique biological function among herpesviral proteins . It is responsible for the disruption of Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) latency and the induction of the lytic cycle . We have employed the ZEBRA / EBV biological system to test whether a heterologous activation domain can substitute for another activation domain ( the ZEBRA domain ) . The ZEBRA activation region was replaced with the potent acid activation region from the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein or with the activation region of the EBV R protein . Activation was not target - or cell - type dependent , nor was it dependent on the presence of virus . These studies suggest that the specificities of some of the known biological functions of ZEBRA are not dependent upon the nature of the activation domain present within ZEBRA . Interleukin 4 activates a signal transducer and activator of transcription ( Stat ) protein which interacts with an interferon - gamma activation site - like sequence upstream of the I epsilon exon in a human B cell line . Evidence for the involvement of Janus kinase 3 and interleukin - 4 Stat . Germ line C transcripts can be induced by IL - 4 in the human B cell line , BL - 2 . Utilizing a IFN - gamma activation site - like DNA sequence element located upstream of the I epsilon exon , we demonstrated by gel mobility shift assays that IL - 4 induced a binding activity in the cytosol and nucleus of BL - 2 cells . This factor was designated IL - 4 NAF ( IL - 4 - induced nuclear - activating factors ) and was identified as a tyrosine phosphoprotein , which translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus upon IL - 4 treatment . Congruous with the involvement of a Stat protein , IL - 4 induced robust Janus kinase 3 ( JAK3 ) activity in BL - 2 cells . Cotransfection of JAK3 with IL - 4 Stat into COS - 7 cells produced an intracellular activity which bound the same IFN - gamma activation site - like sequence and comigrated with IL - 4 NAF in electrophoretic mobility shift assay . These results show that IL - 4 NAF is IL - 4 Stat , which is activated by JAK3 in response to IL - 4 receptor engagement . Does activation of the TAL1 gene occur in a majority of patients with T - cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ? A pediatric oncology group study . Almost 25 % of patients with T - cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T - ALL ) have tumor - specific rearrangements of the TAL1 gene . Although TAL1 expression has not been observed in normal lymphocytes , TAL1 gene products are readily detected in leukemic cells that harbor a rearranged TAL1 allele . Hence , it has been proposed that ectopic expression of TAL1 promotes the development of T - ALL . In this report , we show that TAL1 is expressed in the leukemic cells of most patients with T - ALL , including many that do not display an apparent TAL1 gene alteration . A polymorphic dinucleotide repeat in the transcribed sequences of TAL1 was used to determine the allele specificity of TAL1 transcription in primary T - ALL cells . Thus , TAL1 activation in these patients may result from subtle alterations in cis - acting regulatory sequences ( affecting expression of a single TAL1 allele ) or changes in trans - acting factors that control TAL1 transcription ( affecting expression of both TAL1 alleles ) . To clarify properties of the blast cells in M7 and TMD cases , we examined erythroid markers expression in blasts from six cases with M7 and seven cases with TMD in this study . We also found that mRNAs encoding GATA - 1 and GATA - 2 are expressed in all these cases . Expression of Ah receptor ( TCDD receptor ) during human monocytic differentiation . We have previously found a high expression of human Ah receptor ( TCDD receptor ) mRNA in peripheral blood cells of individuals . Then the expression levels of AhR mRNA in various hematopoietic cell lines were examined together with those of Arnt and P450IA1 . AhR was expressed at high levels in monocytoid U937 , THP1 , and HEL / S cells , and at moderate levels in promyelocytic HL60 cells and erythroblastic HEL cells . However , it was not detected in lymphoid cells MOLT4 ( T cell ) and BALL1 ( B cell ) , nor in K562 erythroblasts . Furthermore , a specific induction of AhR during monocytic differentiation was investigated in HL60 and HEL cells . HL60 cells were induced to differentiate toward monocytes - macrophages by incubation with phorbol ester , showing a 5 - to 2 - fold increase of AhR mRNA . The HEL cells also exhibited a similar elevation of AhR mRNA level , when they had differentiated toward monocyte - macrophage cells by these combined inducers , but little change in the mRNA level was observed when the cells were induced to differentiate into other cell types . Treatment of the differentiated HL60 cells with 3 - methylcholanthrene , a ligand of AhR , induced the expression of the P450IA1 gene . These results indicated that expression of AhR mRNA was significantly induced during monocytic differentiation and that the differentiated cells were responsive to xenobiotics . Our results suggest that AhR may play an important role in the function of monocytes and also in the eventual activation of environmental carcinogens . Neutrophils and monocytes express high levels of PU . 1 ( Spi - 1 ) but not Spi - B . PU . 1 ( the Spi - 1 oncogene ) and Spi - B are closely related members of the ets transcription factor family , sharing similar DNA binding specificities mediated by similar DNA binding domains . PU . 1 and Spi - B have been previously described as being predominantly expressed coordinately in macrophages and B cells , but their expression in early hematopoietic stages and during the course of myeloid differentiation to monocytes and macrophages or to neutrophils has not been extensively investigated . Here , we report that PU . 1 mRNA is upregulated during myeloid differentiation of human purified CD34 + cells and murine multipotential FDCP - mix A4 cells , suggesting that PU . 1 is upregulated as an early event during differentiation of multipotential progenitor cells . PU . 1 expression is maintained at stable levels during differentiation of myeloid cell lines U937 and HL - 60 to monocytic and neutrophilic cells . PU . 1 is expressed at highest levels in mature human monocytes and human peripheral blood neutrophils . In contrast to PU . 1 , significant levels of Spi - B mRNA and protein are found only in some B - cell lines and spleen but are not found in myeloid cell lines , neutrophils , or macrophages . Therefore , although PU . 1 and Spi - B may bind to similar DNA control elements and have redundancy of transactivation function in vitro , the lack of significant levels of Spi - B in myeloid cells makes it unlikely that Spi - B plays a significant role in myeloid lineage development and gene expression . Identification of a major positive regulatory element located 5 ' to the human zeta - globin gene . The function of the zeta - globin promoter was studied using a series of zeta - globin promoter deletion constructs to drive luciferase expression in transiently transfected human erythroleukemia cells . When the constructs were transfected into OCIM1 cells , which do not express zeta - globin , the zeta - globin promoters were at best 20 % as active as the alpha - globin promoters . When sequences from - 417 to - 207 5 ' to the zeta - globin mRNA cap site were deleted , up to 95 % of the zeta - globin promoter activity was lost in K562 cells . Reinsertion of these sequences into zeta - luciferase constructs missing the - 417 to - 207 region showed that the sequences lack classical enhancer activity . Point mutation of a GATA - 1 site at - 230 reduced promoter activity by 37 % . Point mutation of a CCACC site at - 240 had no effect . Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that the - 230 GATA - 1 site has a relatively low affinity for GATA - 1 . These experiments show the presence of a strong positive - acting element , located between - 417 and - 207 bp 5 ' to the zeta - globin mRNA cap site , is necessary for high - level promoter activity in K562 cells . Analysis of the role of protein kinase C - alpha , - epsilon , and - zeta in T cell activation . T cells express multiple isotypes of protein kinase C ( PKC ) and although it is well accepted that PKCs have an important role in T cell activation , little is known about the function of individual PKC isotypes . p21ras plays an essential role in T cell activation . The data indicate that PKC - epsilon and , to a lesser extent PKC - alpha but not - zeta , can regulate the transcription factors AP - 1 and nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF - AT - 1 ) . PKC - epsilon , but not PKC - alpha nor activated p21ras , was able to induce NF - KB activity . Phorbol esters induce expression of CD69 whereas none of the activated PKC isotypes tested were able to have this effect . Activated Src and p21ras were able to induce CD69 expression . Although glucocorticosteroids are a very effective treatment for asthma and other chronic inflammatory diseases , a small proportion of patients are resistant to their therapeutic effects . The molecular mechanism for this steroid resistance is unclear . Steroid resistance can not be explained by pharmacokinetic mechanisms , by a defect in the binding of steroids to glucocorticoid receptors , nor by defective nuclear translocation of this receptor , thereby suggesting that the molecular abnormality lies distal to nuclear translocation . The binding of the glucocorticoid receptor to DNA in these patients was also studied using Scatchard analysis . Dexamethasone induced a significant rapid and sustained twofold increase in GRE binding in PBMCs from steroid - sensitive asthmatic patients and nonasthmatic individuals , but this was markedly reduced in steroid - resistant asthmatic patients . These results suggest that the ability of the glucocorticoid receptor to bind to GRE is impaired in steroid - resistant patients because of a reduced number of receptors available for binding to DNA . At present , not much is known about the molecular mechanisms by which interleukin - 5 ( IL - 5 ) exerts its diverse biologic effects . Human eosinophils are one of the most important target cells for IL - 5 and were used here to study IL - 5 signaling in a primary human cell . IL - 5 induced rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 . Moreover , IL - 5 induced at least two DNA - binding complexes , using nuclear extracts from normal human eosinophils and the IL - 6 / interferon - gamma response element of the ICAM - 1 promoter ( ICAM - 1 pIRE ) in an electromobility shift assay . Both DNA - binding complexes were inhibited by a phosphotyrosine antibody ( 4G10 ) , suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation is required for complex formation . IL - 3 and granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor induced , similar to IL - 5 , two DNA - binding complexes in human eosinophils , including Stat1 alpha . These data show for the first time that molecular mechanisms of IL - 5 signaling in human eosinophils involve members of the JAK kinase family as well as members of the Stat family . Infection and replication of Tat - human immunodeficiency viruses : genetic analyses of LTR and tat mutations in primary and long - term human lymphoid cells . Tat is an essential regulatory protein for the replication of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Mutations in the tat gene have been shown to block HIV replication in human T cells . Several studies have established that Tat releases an elongation block to the transcription of HIV long terminal repeat ( LTR ) ; however , it is not known whether this mechanism alone is sufficient to explain the block to HIV replication in human T cells when Tat is absent . It is possible that Tat is also needed for other functions during HIV replication . To test these hypotheses , we studied several tat mutants , including two stop codon mutants and one deletion mutant using replication - competent HIV - 1 constructs carrying wild - type or mutant LTRs with modifications in the NF - kappa B and / or Sp1 binding sites . In this study , we show that Tat - HIV - 1 with wild - type LTRs can replicate in HeLa cells , and the virus produced from HeLa cells can infect primary peripheral blood lymphocytes and macrophages . Large amounts of viral RNA and particles were synthesized in infections established using the tat mutants that contain modified LTRs . However , this efficient propagation of the LTR - modified tat mutants was restricted to some lymphoid cell lines that have been transformed with other viruses . Thus , despite its essential role for releasing an elongation block , Tat is not otherwise absolutely required for synthesis of full - length HIV transcripts and assembly of virus particles . Direct sequencing of the viral genomes and reinfection kinetics showed no evidence of wild - type reversion even after prolonged infection with the Tat - virus . The implications for in vivo HIV - 1 replication and potential application of this system to the study of alternative Tat function are discussed . Functional roles of the transcription factor Oct - 2A and the high mobility group protein I / Y in HLA - DRA gene expression . The class II major histocompatibility complex gene HLA - DRA is expressed in B cells , activated T lymphocytes , and in antigen - presenting cells . In addition , HLA - DRA gene expression is inducible in a variety of cell types by interferon - gamma ( IFN - gamma ) . Coexpression of HMG I / Y and Oct - 2 in cell lines lacking Oct - 2 results in high levels of HLA - DRA gene expression , and in vitro DNA - binding studies reveal that HMG I / Y stimulates Oct - 2A binding to the HLA - DRA promoter . Thus , Oct - 2A and HMG I / Y may synergize to activate HLA - DRA expression in B cells . By contrast , Oct - 2A is not involved in the IFN - gamma induction of the HLA - DRA gene in HeLa cells , but antisense HMG I / Y dramatically decreases the level of induction . Heterogeneous expression of Epstein - Barr virus latent proteins in endemic Burkitt ' s lymphoma . Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) - infected cells may sustain three distinct forms of virus latency . This form of latency , termed latency III , is also encountered in some posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders . We have studied the expression of EBV proteins in 17 cases of EBV - positive endemic BL by immunohistology . The activation of the Jak - STAT 1 signaling pathway by IL - 5 in eosinophils . The intracellular signal transduction of IL - 5 in eosinophils is unknown . The objective of this study was to investigate the involvement of the newly discovered Jak - STAT pathway in the IL - 5 signal transduction mechanism . The involvement of Jak 2 was investigated by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting for tyrosine phosphorylation . The activation of Jak 2 was studied by autophosphorylation of the immunoprecipitated kinase . Jak 2 was tyrosine phosphorylated within 1 to 3 min after stimulation of eosinophils with IL - 5 . Further , the immunoprecipitated Jak 2 obtained from IL - 5 - stimulated cells underwent autophosphorylation . Jak 2 coprecipitated with the beta - subunit of the IL - 5 receptor , suggesting a physical association of the kinase with the receptor . The nuclear factor STAT - 1 ( p91 ) was investigated by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting for tyrosine phosphorylation . STAT - 1 was tyrosine phosphorylated within 15 min of IL - 5 stimulation . The presence of STAT - 1 in the nuclear extract was studied by electrophoretic mobility shift assay . IL - 5 induced two proteins that bound to the gamma - activating sequence . In the presence of an anti - STAT - 1 Ab , the band was supershifted . Thus , we demonstrated that IL - 5 activated the Jak 2 - STAT 1 signaling pathway in eosinophils . We speculate that the Jak 2 - STAT 1 pathway may be involved in the activation of IL - 5 - inducible genes in eosinophils . Reduced mitogenic stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells as a prognostic parameter for the course of breast cancer : a prospective longitudinal study . In the present study , the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) in response to mitogenic stimulation with phytohaemagglutinin ( PHA ) was assessed prospectively in 90 patients with stage I - III breast cancer . After an additional 6 months ( i . e . 12 months after surgery ) , PHA - induced proliferation of PBMCs was similar in patients after adjuvant chemotherapy with CMF and in those receiving continued adjuvant tamoxifen treatment ( P > 0 . 1 ) , but in all patients still significantly decreased as compared with healthy controls ( P < 0 . 001 ) . When data obtained preoperatively and after 12 months were compared , it was found that out of 23 patients whose PBMCs had experienced a drop in their PHA - induced proliferation , 14 ( 61 % ) had developed metastatic disease within the subsequent 24 months ( i . e . 36 months after surgery ) . In contrast , out of 59 patients whose PBMCs showed an increase in their PHA - induced proliferation within the first 12 months after surgery , only one ( 2 % ) presented with disease progression . Activation of transcription by binding of NF - E1 ( YY1 ) to a newly identified element in the first exon of the human DR alpha gene . Mutations in this DNA - binding site abolished binding of a nuclear factor in human B cell nuclear extract and decreased the activity of the DR alpha promoter to a basal level . Significant sequence homology of this element was found in the DNA of the DR beta , DP alpha and - beta , and DQ alpha genes , always located downstream of the transcriptional start site . It was identified as NF - E1 ( YY1 ) . This protein , previously identified by its binding to the Ig kappa 3 ' enhancer and the Ig heavy chain mu E1 site , thus also appears to be quite important in the regulation of MHC class II gene expression . Transcriptional activity of core binding factor - alpha ( AML1 ) and beta subunits on murine leukemia virus enhancer cores . Core binding factor ( CBF ) , also known as polyomavirus enhancer - binding protein 2 and SL3 enhancer factor 1 , is a mammalian transcription factor that binds to an element termed the core within the enhancers of the murine leukemia virus family of retroviruses . The core elements of the SL3 virus are important genetic determinants of the ability of this virus to induce T - cell lymphomas and the transcriptional activity of the viral long terminal repeat in T lymphocytes . CBF consists of two subunits , a DNA binding subunit , CBF alpha , and a second subunit , CBF beta , that stimulates the DNA binding activity of CBF alpha . This locus is rearranged by chromosomal translocations in human myeloproliferative disorders and leukemias . An exogenously expressed Cbf alpha 2 - encoded subunit ( CBF alpha 2 - 451 ) stimulated transcription from the SL3 enhancer in P19 and HeLa cells . Activity was mediated through the core elements . The longest form , CBF beta - 187 , increased the transcriptional stimulation by CBF alpha 2 - 451 twofold in HeLa cells , although it had no effect in P19 cells . Transcriptional activation by CBF beta required binding to the CBF alpha subunit , as a form of CBF beta that lacked binding ability , CBF beta - 148 , failed to increase activity . They also provided support for the hypothesis that CBF is a factor in T lymphocytes that is responsible for recognition of the SL3 cores . This difference strongly affects transcription in T cells and leukemogenicity of SL3 . Thus , a complete understanding of how T cells recognize the SL3 core remains to be elucidated . Interleukin ( IL ) - 10 inhibits nuclear factor kappa B ( NF kappa B ) activation in human monocytes . IL - 10 and IL - 4 suppress cytokine synthesis by different mechanisms . Our previous studies in human monocytes have demonstrated that interleukin ( IL ) - 10 inhibits lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - stimulated production of inflammatory cytokines , IL - 1 beta , IL - 6 , IL - 8 , and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - alpha by blocking gene transcription . This selective inhibition by IL - 10 of NF kappa B activation occurs rapidly and in a dose - dependent manner and correlates well with IL - 10 ' s cytokine synthesis inhibitory activity in terms of both kinetics and dose responsiveness . IL - 4 , another cytokine that inhibits cytokine mRNA accumulation in monocytes , shows little inhibitory effect on LPS - induced NF kappa B activation . Further examination reveals that , unlike IL - 10 , IL - 4 enhances mRNA degradation and does not suppress cytokine gene transcription . These data indicate that IL - 10 and IL - 4 inhibit cytokine production by different mechanisms . LMP - 1 activates NF - kappa B by targeting the inhibitory molecule I kappa B alpha . LMP - 1 , an Epstein - Barr virus membrane protein expressed during latent infection , has oncogenic properties , as judged from its ability to transform B lymphocytes and rodent fibroblasts . LMP - 1 induces the expression of bcl2 , an oncogene which protects cells from apoptosis , as well as of genes encoding other proteins involved in cell regulation and growth control . The mechanisms by which LMP - 1 upregulates these proteins is unknown , but it is plausible that LMP - 1 modifies signal transduction pathways that result in the activation of one or more transcription factors that ultimately regulate transcription of oncogenic genes . NF - kappa B , a transcription factor controlling the expression of genes involved in cell activation and growth control , has been shown to be activated by LMP - 1 . The mechanism ( s ) regulating this activation remains unknown . Our data indicate that increased NF - kappa B DNA binding and functional activity are present in B - lymphoid cells stably or transiently expressing LMP - 1 . I kappa B alpha is selectively modified in LMP - 1 - expressing B cells . A phosphorylated form of I kappa B alpha and increased protein turnover - degradation correlate with increased NF - kappa B nuclear translocation . This results in increased transcription of NF - kappa B - dependent - genes , including those encoding p105 and I kappa B alpha ( MAD3 ) . These results indicate that LMP - 1 activates NF - kappa B in B - cell lines by targeting I kappa B alpha . Identification of the pathways activated by LMP - 1 to result in posttranslational modifications of I kappa B alpha will aid in determining the role of this virus - host cell protein interaction in Epstein - Barr virus - mediated oncogenesis . Identification of human TR2 orphan receptor response element in the transcriptional initiation site of the simian virus 40 major late promoter [ published erratum appears in J Biol Chem 1995 Nov 3 ; 270 ( 44 ) : 26721 ] A DNA response element ( TR2RE - SV40 ) for the TR2 orphan receptor , a member of the steroid - thyroid hormone receptor superfamily , has been identified in the simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) + 55 region ( nucleotide numbers 368 - 389 , 5 ' - GTTAAGGTTCGTAGGTCATG - 3 ' ) . Electrophoretic mobility shift assay , using in vitro translated TR2 orphan receptor with a molecular mass of 67 kilodaltons , showed a specific binding with high affinity ( dissociation constant = 9 nM ) for this DNA sequence . DNA - swap experiments using chloramphenicol acetyl - transferase assay demonstrated that androgen can suppress the transcriptional activities of SV40 early promoter via the interaction between this TR2RE - SV40 and the chimeric receptor AR / TR2 / AR with the DNA - binding domain of the TR2 orphan receptor flanked by the N - terminal and androgen - binding domains of the androgen receptor . Together , these data suggest the TR2RE - SV40 may represent the first identified natural DNA response element for the TR2 orphan receptor that may function as a repressor for the SV40 gene expression . Detection of the chromosome 16 CBF beta - MYH11 fusion transcript in myelomonocytic leukemias . Karyotypic detection of chromosomal 16 abnormalities classically associated with AML M4Eo can be difficult . Characterization of the two genes involved in the inv ( 16 ) ( p13q22 ) , CBF beta and MYH11 , has allowed the detection of fusion transcripts by reverse - transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) . All 11 typical AML M4Eo were CBF beta - MYH11 positive . The single case of AML M4 with distinctive eosinophil abnormalities was negative by karyotype , RT - PCR and fluorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ) . Three of 29 ( 10 % ) AML M4 without abnormal eosinophils were CBF beta - MYH11 positive , 1 of which did not show any apparent chromosome 16 abnormalities by classical metaphase analysis ( 2 not tested ) . None of the other leukemias were RT - PCR positive . These data show that CBF beta - MYH11 fusion transcripts occur not only in the vast majority of typical AML M4Eo , but also in approximately 10 % of AML M4 without eosinophilic abnormalities , a much higher incidence than the sporadic reports of chromosome 16 abnormalities in AML M4 would suggest . Taken together with the detection of CBF beta - MYH11 transcripts in the absence of apparent chromosome 16 abnormalities by classical banding techniques , these data show that additional screening by either RT - PCR or FISH should be performed in all AML M4 , regardless of morphologic features , to allow accurate evaluation of the prognostic importance of this fusion transcript . This study demonstrates that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) Tat protein amplifies the activity of tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) , a cytokine that stimulates HIV - 1 replication through activation of NF - kappa B . A similar potentiation of TNF effects was observed in Jurkat T cells and HeLa cells treated with soluble Tat protein . TNF - mediated activation of NF - kappa B and cytotoxicity involves the intracellular formation of reactive oxygen intermediates . Therefore , Tat - mediated effects on the cellular redox state were analyzed . In both T cells and HeLa cells HIV - 1 Tat suppressed the expression of Mn - dependent superoxide dismutase ( Mn - SOD ) , a mitochondrial enzyme that is part of the cellular defense system against oxidative stress . Decreased Mn - SOD expression was associated with decreased levels of glutathione and a lower ratio of reduced : oxidized glutathione . A truncated Tat protein ( Tat1 - 72 ) , known to transactivate the HIV - 1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) , no longer affected Mn - SOD expression , the cellular redox state or TNF - mediated cytotoxicity . Thus , our experiments demonstrate that the C - terminal region of HIV - 1 Tat is required to suppress Mn - SOD expression and to induce pro - oxidative conditions reflected by a drop in reduced glutathione ( GSH ) and the GSH : oxidized GSH ( GSSG ) ratio . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) Molecular , cellular , and clinical considerations . However , optimal agents , doses , and / or schedules have yet to be defined despite extensive clinical application . These suggest that prolonged , i . e . 28 day , glucocorticoid therapy may be unnecessary as exposure to glucocorticoid induces down - regulation of glucocorticoid receptors . Dexamethasone may be superior to prednisone in conventional equi - effective doses . Increasing success in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia has led to increasing awareness of avascular necrosis of bone as a potentially disabling sequela of glucocorticoid therapy , especially in adolescent and young adult patients . Epstein - Barr virus nuclear protein 2 transactivation of the latent membrane protein 1 promoter is mediated by J kappa and PU . 1 . The previously characterized factors J kappa , PU . 1 , and AML1 bind to the LMP - 1 E2RE , along with six other unidentified factors ( LBF2 to LBF7 ) . Binding sites were mapped for each factor . LBF4 has a molecular mass of 105 kDa and is probably unrelated to PU . 1 . LBF2 was found only in epithelial cell lines , whereas LBF3 , LBF5 , LBF6 , and LBF7 were not cell type specific . Mutations of the AML1 - or LBF4 - binding sites had no effect on EBNA - 2 transactivation , whereas mutation of the PU . 1 - binding site completely eliminated EBNA - 2 responses . A gst - EBNA - 2 fusion protein specifically depleted PU . 1 from nuclear extracts and bound in vitro translated PU . 1 , providing biochemical evidence for a direct EBNA - 2 - PU . 1 interaction . Thus , EBNA - 2 transactivation of the LMP - 1 promoter is dependent on interaction with at least two distinct sequence - specific DNA - binding proteins , J kappa and PU . 1 . LBF3 , LBF5 , LBF6 , or LBF7 may also be involved , since their binding sites also contribute to EBNA - 2 responsiveness . Lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptor : predictor of sertraline response in adolescent major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) in adolescents demonstrates resistance to tricyclic antidepressants and absence of hypercortisolemia . In an open - label study , adolescents ( n = 20 ) meeting DSM - III - R criteria for MDD showed baseline lymphocyte GCII sites per cell ( sites / cell ) values of 793 + / - 106 versus 2 , 563 + / - 499 ( + / - SEM ) for matched controls ( n = 18 ) ( t = 3 . 5 ; df = 36 ; p < . 001 ) . GCII was bimodally distributed , with SRI responders differing from nonresponders ( t = 3 . 9 ; df = 14 ; p < . 001 ) . GCII accurately classified 90 percent of sertraline responders and 80 percent of nonresponders . Only SRI responders showed GCII sites / cell upregulated after 6 weeks of treatment ( t = 2 . 1 , df = 10 ; p < . 05 ) . The tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF alpha ) gene is an immediate early gene in activated T cells , in that it is rapidly induced without a requirement for protein synthesis . Maximal induction of TNF alpha mRNA can be induced by treatment of T cells with calcium ionophores alone , via a calcineurin - dependent process that is blocked by cyclosporin A . We have previously identified a promoter element , kappa 3 , that is required for calcium - stimulated , cyclosporin A - sensitive induction of the TNF alpha gene in activated T cells . Here , we demonstrate that the kappa 3 binding factor contains NFATp , a cyclosporin - sensitive DNA - binding protein required for interleukin - 2 gene transcription . NFATp binds to two sites within the kappa 3 element , and occupancy of both sites is required for TNF alpha gene induction . The involvement of NFATp in transcriptional activation of both the interleukin - 2 and TNF alpha genes suggests that this factor plays an important role in the coordinate induction of multiple cytokine genes , starting at the earliest stages of T cell activation . Regulation and specificity of MNDA expression in monocytes , macrophages , and leukemia / B lymphoma cell lines . The expression of the human myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen ( MNDA ) was observed specifically in cells of the granulocyte - macrophage lineage in our earlier reports . The specificity of MNDA expression for cells in the granulocyte - macrophage lineage was reexamined in cell lines established from patients with Philadelphia chromosome - positive chronic myeloid leukemia . Cell lines that expressed MNDA exhibited myeloid cell features and granulocyte or monocyte differentiation could be induced in vitro , while cell lines exhibiting properties of very early stage cells or multipotential cells did not express MNDA . Cells originating from cases of Burkitt ' s lymphoma were negative . As we reported previously , MNDA mRNA level in adherent monocytes is elevated by IFN - alpha ; in this study , we further assessed MNDA expression in in vitro monocyte - derived macrophages . Three additional agents ( endotoxin , phytohemagglutinin , and phorbol ester ) and other conditions that affect function , cytokine production , differentiation , and / or growth of monocytes were examined for their ability to alter MNDA expression . The results also reveal a discordance in certain MNDA positive cells between steady - state levels or changes in levels of protein and mRNA indicating that the regulation of MNDA expression occurs at more than one point . Changes in MNDA expression are consistent with a role in opposing macrophage differentiation and activation of monocytes / macrophages . DNA - binding studies of the Epstein - Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 ( EBNA - 2 ) : evidence for complex formation by latent membrane protein gene promoter - binding proteins in EBNA - 2 - positive cell lines . The Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) nuclear antigen 2 ( EBNA - 2 ) protein is essential for the immortalization of human primary B cells by EBV . EBNA - 2 trans - activates cellular and viral genes like CD23 , c - fgr , latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP1 ) and terminal protein 1 ( TP1 ) . Trans - activation of the TP1 promoter and of the BamHI C promoter has already been investigated in detail and appears to be mediated via protein - protein interactions and not by direct binding of EBNA - 2 type A ( of EBV type 1 ) to the DNA . To determine whether EBNA - 2 also trans - activates the LMP promoter by protein - protein interactions , we performed a series of gel retardation assays and competition experiments with LMP promoter fragments of different sizes . We determined that the protein - binding region on the LMP promoter was within a 42 bp fragment encompassing nucleotides - 135 to - 176 relative to the LMP transcriptional start site . None of the DNA fragments investigated indicated interaction of EBNA - 2 with the DNA via protein - protein interactions . No significant differences between EBNA - 2 - positive and EBNA - 2 - negative nuclear extracts could be seen in the gel retardation assay under conditions that clearly showed binding of EBNA - 2A to the TP1 promoter . However , analysis of sucrose gradient fractions in the gel retardation assay provided evidence that the LMP promoter - binding proteins form a complex of higher M ( r ) in EBNA - 2 - positive cell extracts . We deduce from these results that EBNA - 2 - positive cells might indeed contain specific complexes bound to the LMP promoter which are , however , too labile to be detected in a standard gel retardation assay . Simultaneous activation of Ig and Oct - 2 synthesis and reduction of surface MHC class II expression by IL - 6 . Terminal differentiation of B cells to plasma cells in vivo is characterized by secretion of Ig and extinction of MHC class II expression on the cell surface . We show that IL - 6 signaling leads to marked increases in the synthesis and secretion of Ig in clonal human B cell lines and newly isolated polyclonal B lymphocytes in vitro . The IL - 6 - induced cells resemble plasma cells in ultrastructure and in reduced expression of surface MHC class II . Coordinate with temporal changes in Ig synthesis , the DNA - binding activity and the synthesis of the B cell - enriched transcription factor Oct - 2 are regulated . T - cell functional regions of the human IL - 3 proximal promoter . The human interleukin - 3 ( IL - 3 ) gene is expressed almost exclusively in activated T cells . Its expression is regulated at both the transcriptional and post - transcriptional level . To define the regions of the gene required for transcription activation , we generated a series of reporter constructs containing different regions of the IL - 3 gene 5 ' and 3 ' flanking sequences . Both positive and negative regulatory elements were identified in the proximal 5 ' flanking region of the IL - 3 gene . The promoter region between - 173 and - 60 contained the strongest activating elements . The transcription factor AP - 1 could bind to this positive activator region of the promoter . Expression of the Runt domain - encoding PEBP2 alpha genes in T cells during thymic development . The PEBP2 alpha A and PEBP2 alpha B genes encode the DNA - binding subunit of a murine transcription factor , PEBP2 , which is implicated as a T - cell - specific transcriptional regulator . These two related genes share the evolutionarily conserved region encoding the Runt domain . PEBP2 alpha B is the murine counterpart of human AML1 , which is located at the breakpoints of the 8 ; 21 and 3 ; 21 chromosome translocations associated with acute myeloid leukemia . Northern ( RNA ) blots of various adult mouse tissues revealed that the levels of expression of both genes were most prominent in the thymus . Furthermore , transcripts of PEBP2 alpha A and mouse AML1 / PEBP2 alpha B were detected in T lymphocytes in the thymuses from day 16 embryos and newborns , as well as 4 - week - old adult mice , by in situ hybridization . The expression of the genes persisted in peripheral lymph nodes of adult mice . The transcripts were detected in all the CD4 - CD8 - , CD4 + CD8 + , CD4 + CD8 - , and CD4 - CD8 + cell populations . The results indicated that both genes are expressed in T cells throughout their development , supporting the notion that PEBP2 is a T - cell - specific transcription factor . Transcripts of mouse AML1 / PEBP2 alpha B were also detected in day 12 fetal hematopoietic liver and in the bone marrow cells of newborn mice . The implication of mouse AML1 / PEBP2 alpha B expression in hematopoietic cells other than those of T - cell lineage is discussed in relation to myeloid leukemogenesis . Effects of glucocorticoids on transcription factor activation in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells . The interaction of the transcription factors , activator protein - 1 ( AP - 1 ) , nuclear factor kappa B ( NF kappa B ) , and cAMP - responsive element binding protein ( CREB ) with DNA and glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) was analyzed in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by gel mobility shift assays . Dexamethasone produced a rapid and sustained increase in glucocorticoid response element binding and a concomitant 40 - 50 % decrease in AP - 1 , NF kappa B , and CREB DNA binding that was blocked by combined dexamethasone and cytokine or PMA treatment . These latter effects were due to increases in the nuclear localization of GR , not to reduced amounts of the other transcription factors . This suggests that in these cells GR within the nucleus interacts with cytokine - stimulated transcription factors by the process of cross coupling . Differential induction of the NF - AT complex during restimulation and the induction of T - cell anergy . Stimulation of human CD4 + T - cell clones through the T - cell receptor ( TcR ) by high doses of specific peptide results in the induction of a long - lived state of nonresponsiveness that has been called anergy . The amount of TcR at the cell surface is downmodulated , whereas the CD2 and CD25 receptors are increased . In this study , we have compared the ability of various transcription factors to bind to their appropriate site on DNA . Factors were isolated from the nuclei of T cells that were in the induction phase of anergy or were undergoing activation . The pattern of binding activity in restimulated T cells is consistent with the pattern that has previously been shown to regulate T - cell - specific expression of the IL - 2 and the beta chain of the TcR genes . The measured binding to a TCF - 1 site is the same in the nuclei of resting , activated , and anergized cells . The inducible factors NK - kappa B , beta E2 , CD28RC , and AP - 1 are not expressed in resting cells and are twofold lower in anergized as compared with activated cells . In contrast , anergic T cells express approximately eightfold lower amounts of NF - AT , a member of the class of inducible factors that regulates IL - 2 gene transcription . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) The number of glucocorticoid receptors in peripheral human lymphocytes is elevated by a zinc containing trace element preparation . A trace element preparation ( Beres Drops Plus , BDP ) elevates the number of glucocorticoid receptors ( gcR ) in peripheral lymphocytes isolated both from healthy blood donors and rheumatoid arthritis patients . This enhancement by BDP was found either for constitutive expression of gcRs or in experiments when the lymphocytes were stimulated by interleukin ( IL ) - 6 . There was no significant effect of BDP on IL - 1 and tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) - induced changes of gcRs . The DNA and steroid binding domains of the glucocorticoid receptor are not altered in mononuclear cells of treated CLL patients . The aim of this study was to investigate whether mutations in the glucocorticoid receptor could account for the increasing unresponsiveness of patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia ( CLL ) to combination chemotherapy . The receptor was tested immunocytochemically , in steroid binding assays , and by a mutation screening ( denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ) of the receptor - cDNA . In one individual who had not been treated before analysis a silent mutation was found in one receptor allele . The results suggest that mechanisms other than altered ligand or DNA binding of the receptor may be responsible for the lack of response to chemotherapy . This conclusion is discussed in relation to the mechanism of corticoid resistance in mouse and human lymphoma cells in culture . An AP1 binding site upstream of the kappa immunoglobulin intron enhancer binds inducible factors and contributes to expression . A new protein - DNA interaction has been identified upstream of the intron enhancer , within the matrix - associated region of the J - C intron . The binding activity is greatly inducible in pre - B cells by bacterial lipopolysaccharide and interleukin - 1 but specific complexes are found at all stages of B cell development tested . The footprinted binding site is homologous to the consensus AP1 motif . The protein components of this complex are specifically competed by an AP1 consensus motif and were shown by supershift to include c - Jun and c - Fos , suggesting that this binding site is an AP1 motif and that the Jun and Fos families of transcription factors play a role in the regulation of the kappa light chain gene . Mutation of the AP1 motif in the context of the intron enhancer was shown to decrease enhancer - mediated activation of the promoter in both pre - B cells induced with LPS and constitutive expression in mature B cells . Distinct DNase - I hypersensitive sites are associated with TAL - 1 transcription in erythroid and T - cell lines . The tal - 1 gene , frequently activated in human T - cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T - ALL ) , is expressed in the erythroid , megakaryocytic , and mast cell lineages during normal hematopoiesis . To gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms that control tal - 1 expression , we investigated tal - 1 chromatin structure in erythroid / megakaryocytic cell lines and in T - cell lines either with or without tal - 1 rearrangements . Tal - 1 transcription was shown to be monoallelic in Jurkat , a T - cell line that expresses tal - 1 in the absence of apparent genomic alteration of the locus . Five major DNase - I hypersensitive sites ( HS ) were mapped in the tal - 1 locus . HS I , IV , and V were exclusively observed in the erythroid / megakaryocytic cell lines that express tal - 1 from the promoters 1a and 1b . HS II was weak in hematopoietic cell lines , absent in Hela , and greatly enhanced in Jurkat , suggesting that this region might be implicated in the cis - activation of tal - 1 promoter 1b in this cell line . HS III was weak in HEL and Jurkat , and greatly enhanced in DU528 , a T - cell line that bears a t ( 1 ; 14 ) and initiates tal - 1 transcription within exon 4 . These results suggest that distinct regulatory elements are associated with the use of the different tal - 1 promoters . Erythropoietin - dependent induction of hemoglobin synthesis in a cytokine - dependent cell line M - TAT . We cultured M - TAT cells long term ( > 1 year ) in the continuous presence of erythropoietin ( EPO ) , granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) , or stem cell factor ( SCF ) . These long term cultures are referred to as M - TAT / EPO , M - TAT / GM - CSF , and M - TAT / SCF cells , respectively . Hemoglobin concentration and gamma - globin and erythroid delta - aminolevulinate synthase mRNA levels were significantly higher in M - TAT / EPO cells than in M - TAT / GM - CSF cells . When the supplemented cytokine was switched from GM - CSF to EPO , hemoglobin synthesis in M - TAT / GM - CSF cells increased rapidly ( within 5 h ) , and the level of GATA - 1 mRNA increased . Thus , erythroid development of M - TAT cells is promoted by EPO and suppressed by GM - CSF . These results support the hypothesis that EPO actively influences the programming of gene expression required for erythroid progenitor cell differentiation . The role of cellular transcription factor E2F in the regulation of cdc2 mRNA expression and cell cycle control of human hematopoietic cells . cdc2 mRNA transcripts were detected in immature bone marrow cells and became undetectable along with differentiation . Peripheral blood resting cells did not express cdc2 mRNA , but it was induced in T - lymphocytes when the cells reentered the cell cycle in response to specific mitogens . In contrast , cdc2 mRNA could not be induced in granulocytes and monocytes even after the culture with the appropriate stimulants . In order to investigate the mechanism of the regulation of cdc2 mRNA expression in hematopoietic cells , we isolated the 5 ' - flanking sequence of the cdc2 gene and found the putative E2F binding site at the position of nucleotides - 124 to - 117 . The binding of E2F at this region was detected by a gel - retardation assay and DNaseI footprinting in phytohemagglutinin - stimulated T - lymphocytes , which was coincident with the expression of cdc2 mRNA . E2F binding was not observed in both granulocytes and monocytes . The induction of E2F activity preceded the appearance of cdc2 mRNA , which is consistent with the role of E2F in the regulation of cdc2 mRNA expression . These results suggest that cdc2 mRNA expression is related to the cell cycling of normal human hematopoietic cells and that E2F plays some roles in the regulation of its expression . A wide spectrum of levels of HIV - 1 expression have been demonstrated in various cells , both in cell culture and in vivo . Molecular mechanisms leading to restricted HIV - 1 replication may differ between certain cell types . It is now demonstrated that HIV - 1 proviral latency in the monocytic cell line U1 , in which only extremely low levels of HIV - 1 expression are detected in the baseline unstimulated state , is associated with alterations in nuclear factor - kappa B ( NF - kappa B ) moieties demonstrated in these cells by electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) and in situ UV cross - linking studies . A predominance of p50 NF - kappa B moieties and possibly p50 homodimers or closely related species , rather than the p50 - p56 heterodimer of NF - kappa B that is the predominant NF - kappa B species in most T lymphocytic and monocytic cells , is demonstrated in the nuclei of U1 cells . This pattern of NF - kappa B - related moieties differs from the latently infected T lymphocytic cell line ACH - 2 , and from the U937 monocytic line , the parental cell line of the U1 cellular clone . As such , these data suggest that different proximal mechanisms may lead to restricted HIV - 1 replication in various cell types . [ Regulation of transcription of the interleukin - 2 gene in B - lymphocytes ] Since most B cell clones immortalized with EBV virus can be induced to produce interleukin - 2 , a typical T cell cytokine , we studied the role of different elements of the IL - 2 promoter in such clones by transfection . It was found , in particular , that the element TCEd , which binds the transcription factor NF - kB , is very active in all three B clones tested . This element has no activity in T cells of the Jurkat line . Different elements thus contribute to IL - 2 promoter activity in different cells . Regulation of I kappa B alpha and p105 in monocytes and macrophages persistently infected with human immunodeficiency virus . The mechanisms regulating human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) persistence in human monocytes / macrophages are partially understood . Persistent HIV infection of U937 monocytic cells results in NF - kappa B activation . Whether virus - induced NF - kappa B activation is a mechanism that favors continuous viral replication in macrophages remains unknown . To further delineate the molecular mechanisms involved in the activation of NF - kappa B in HIV - infected monocytes and macrophages , we have focused on the regulation of the I kappa B molecules . First , we show that persistent HIV infection results in the activation of NF - kappa B not only in monocytic cells but also in macrophages . In HIV - infected cells , I kappa B alpha protein levels are decreased secondary to enhanced protein degradation . Another protein with I kappa B function , p105 , is also modified in HIV - infected cells : p105 and p50 steady - state protein levels are increased as a result of increased synthesis and proteolytic processing of p105 . These results demonstrate the existence of a triple autoregulatory loop in monocytes and macrophages involving HIV , p105 and p50 , and MAD3 , with the end result of persistent NF - kappa B activation and viral persistence . Furthermore , persistent HIV infection of monocytes and macrophages provides a useful model with which to study concomitant modifications of different I kappa B molecules . Glucocorticoid - induced apoptosis of human leukemic cells is caused by the repressive function of the glucocorticoid receptor . Induction of apoptosis in lymphocytes , which may account for the therapeutic effects of glucocorticoids in various diseases including leukemia , depends on the glucocorticoid receptor . However , the events leading from the activated receptor to cell lysis are not understood . A prevailing hypothesis postulates induction of so - called ' lysis genes ' by the activated receptor . Furthermore , we show that retinoic acid can also induce apoptosis in these cells through the retinoic acid receptor , whose repressive functions but not target site specificity , are similar to those of the glucocorticoid receptor . Therefore , the primary effect of the receptor in glucocorticoid - mediated apoptosis correlates with transcriptional repression rather than activation and could be mediated by interference with other transcription factors required for cell survival . NF - kappa B is a nuclear protein of the rel oncogene family capable of enhancing transcription of several cellular genes , including IL - 2 and the IL - 2 receptor , and viral genes transcribed from the HIV - 1 LTR . In this study the effects of HIV protease on NF - kappa B precursor activation were examined in Jurkat T cells by introducing a protease expression vector into the cells . Increased NF - kappa B activity was observed and this increased activity was blocked by a specific inhibitor of the viral protease . Viral transcription , as measured using LTR - CAT assays , was only slightly enhanced in the HIV - protease expressing cells , while secretion of IL - 2 and expression of the IL - 2 receptor were not affected . The limited activation of NF - kappa B by HIV protease appears unlikely to have a significant effect on virus expression or T cell function . Inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication by a Tat - activated , transduced interferon gene : targeted expression to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 - infected cells . We have examined the feasibility of using interferon ( IFN ) gene transfer as a novel approach to anti - human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) therapy in this study . To limit expression of a transduced HIV - 1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) - IFNA2 ( the new approved nomenclature for IFN genes is used throughout this article ) hybrid gene to the HIV - 1 - infected cells , HIV - 1 LTR was modified . Deletion of the NF - kappa B elements of the HIV - 1 LTR significantly inhibited Tat - mediated transactivation in T - cell lines , as well as in a monocyte line , U937 . Replacement of the NF - kappa B elements in the HIV - 1 LTR by a DNA fragment derived from the 5 ' - flanking region of IFN - stimulated gene 15 ( ISG15 ) , containing the IFN - stimulated response element , partially restored Tat - mediated activation of LTR in T cells as well as in monocytes . ISG15 - LTR - IFN hybrid gene inserted into the retrovirus vector was transduced into Jurkat and U937 cells . Enhancement of IFNA synthesis observed upon HIV - 1 infection resulted in significant inhibition of HIV - 1 replication for a period of at least 30 days . Virus isolated from IFNA - producing cells was able to replicate in the U937 cells but did not replicate efficiently in U937 cells transduced with the IFNA gene . These results suggest that targeting IFN synthesis to HIV - 1 - infected cells is an attainable goal and that autocrine IFN synthesis results in a long - lasting and permanent suppression of HIV - 1 replication . Chromosomal localization of two KOX zinc finger genes on chromosome bands 7q21 - q22 . Human cDNAs encoding Kruppel - type zinc finger domains , designated KOX 1 - 32 , have been cloned from human T lymphocyte cell line libraries . We report here the regional localizations by in situ hybridization of KOX 18 and KOX 25 on chromosome bands 7q21q22 . Pulse - field gel electrophoresis ( PFGE ) analysis showed that these genes are physically located within a DNA fragment of 250 kb . The genes KOX 4 and KOX 9 , mapped on chromosome 8q24 , were found to be located within a DNA fragment of 450 kb . From the present and previous data , eighteen different KOX genes have been located at least two by two within nine DNA fragments of 200 to 580 kb . Influence of age on the production of Fos and Jun by influenza virus - exposed T cells . This study investigated age - related T cell responses after in vitro exposure to influenza A virus . Mononuclear leukocytes from young or elderly persons were sham - exposed or exposed to influenza virus for 1 , 24 , and 72 h . Immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometric analysis were then used to detect T cells producing the transcriptional regulating proteins Fos and Jun . Fewer virus - exposed cells from elderly donors stained for Fos and Jun at each data point compared with cells from young donors . Thus , failure of virus - exposed T cells to produce Fos and Jun could contribute to the increase in illness due to influenza virus in the elderly . OBJECTIVES : To analyze the effect of retinoic acids ( RA ) on HIV - 1 expression and correlate this effect with expression levels of RA receptors ( RARs ) in T - lymphoid and monocytoid cell lines . DESIGN AND METHODS : The effect of all - trans and 9 - cis RA on HIV - 1 production in T - lymphoid ( H9 , CEM ) and monocytoid ( U937 , THP - 1 ) cell lines was measured during acute and chronic infection . The expression levels of human RAR alpha ( hRAR alpha , receptor for all - trans RA ) and the human retinoid - X receptor alpha ( hRXR alpha receptor for 9 - cis RA ) were determined by Northern blot analysis . RESULTS : Both all - trans and 9 - cis RA inhibited virus replication in HIV - 1 IIIB - infected monocytoid cells , in the presence and absence of the co - stimulatory agent phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) . The retinoids had weak or no stimulatory effects on HIV production by T - cell lines . HIV production by PMA - stimulated T - cell lines was inhibited by these retinoids . The 9 - cis RA was generally more effective than all - trans RA in inhibiting HIV production and in combination generally more effective than the single agents alone . Human RAR alpha was expressed in H9 , U937 and THP - 1 cells , but almost undetectable in CEM cells . Human RXR alpha was significantly expressed in U937 and THP - 1 cells , weakly expressed in H9 cells and not detectable in CEM cells . After stimulation by PMA , RXR alpha expression increased in H9 and U937 cells but not in CEM cells . Human RAR alpha expression was unchanged in H9 and CEM cells , and elevated in U937 cells , after PMA stimulation . CONCLUSION : The effect of RA on HIV - 1 expression was cell - type - dependent and partially correlated with cellular expression of RARs . Endogenous or exogenously administered RA may have a significant role in HIV regulation . Functions of glutathione and glutathione disulfide in immunology and immunopathology . At low GSSG levels , T cells can not optimally activate the immunologically important transcription factor NF kappa B , whereas high GSSG levels inhibit the DNA binding activity of NF kappa B . The effects of GSSG are antagonized by reduced thioredoxin ( TRX ) . As the protein tyrosine kinase activities p56lck and p59fyn are activated in intact cells by hydrogen peroxide , they are likely targets for GSSG action . These redox - regulated enzymes trigger signal cascades for NF kappa B activation and transduce signals from the T cell antigen receptor , from CD4 and CD8 molecules , and from the IL - 2 receptor beta - chain . The effector phase of cytotoxic T cell responses and IL - 2 - dependent functions are inhibited even by a partial depletion of the intracellular GSH pool . As HIV - infected patients and SIV - infected rhesus macaques have , on the average , significantly decreased plasma cyst ( e ) ine and intracellular GSH levels , we also hypothesize that AIDS may be the consequence of a GSSG deficiency as well . T cells from renal cell carcinoma patients exhibit an abnormal pattern of kappa B - specific DNA - binding activity : a preliminary report . Recent data suggest that the poor induction of a T - cell response to human renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) may be related to alterations in signal transduction pathways . We report that T cells from RCC patients have two alterations in kappa B motif - specific DNA - binding activity . The first alteration involves the constitutive expression of substantial kappa B - binding activity in nuclear extracts , which was observed in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay . The magnitude of kappa B activity in unstimulated patient T cells was similar to that observed in T cells from normal individuals that had been activated in vitro . On the basis of Western blotting experiments using antibodies to kappa B / Rel family proteins , the kappa B - binding activity constitutively expressed in T cells from RCC patients is composed mostly of the NF - kappa B1 ( p50 ) subunit . Western blotting analysis did not detect any RelA in nuclear extracts either before or after stimulation of T cells . The altered kappa B - binding activity in T cells from RCC patients may impair their capacity to respond normally to various stimuli . Hemoglobin switching in humans is accompanied by changes in the ratio of the transcription factors , GATA - 1 and SP1 . BACKGROUND : Understanding the mechanism of developmental regulation of hemoglobin switching has scientific as well as clinical relevance because of the influence of fetal hemoglobin ( HbF ) production in adulthood on the clinical manifestation of thalassemia and sickle cell anemia . We have previously found that the normal developmental patterns of globin gene expression are recapitulated in an experimental system of primary cultures that support differentiation of erythroid progenitors . We further found that high activities of the transcriptional activators , GATA - 1 and SP1 , are associated with normal adult erythroid differentiation . MATERIALS AND METHODS : In the present work , we have studied , the activities of GATA - 1 and SP1 during differentiation of cultured erythroid progenitors derived from cord blood and from fetal livers , as well as from beta zero - thalassemia patients . RESULTS : The results showed high GATA - 1 binding activity and very low SP1 activity in the fetal liver cultures . This pattern was in contrast to cultures derived from normal adult peripheral blood , in which both GATA - 1 and SP1 activities were high . The progenitors derived from a beta zero - thalassemia patient with high HbF production showed ` ` fetal ' ' pattern . On the other hand , in cultures of 2 beta zero - thalassemia patients without high HbF , ` ` adult ' ' pattern was observed . CONCLUSIONS : In the present work , we show that human fetal and adult erythroid progenitors are distinct in their transcription factors , and that the commitment to fetal or adult program occurs at a very early differentiation stage . Transcription - independent turnover of I kappa B alpha during monocyte adherence : implications for a translational component regulating I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 mRNA levels . We identified I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 as an immediate - early gene in human monocytes that is expressed in response to a variety of signals , including adhesion , lipopolysaccharide , and phorbol myristate acetate . Within 5 min of monocyte adhesion , the level of the I kappa B alpha protein is markedly diminished but is rapidly replaced in a cycloheximide - sensitive manner within 20 min . Accompanying the rapid turnover of the I kappa B alpha protein is simultaneous translocation of NF - kappa B - related transcription factors to nuclei of adhered monocytes . The demonstration that NF - kappa B can regulate I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 gene transcription in other cell types suggested that the rapid increase in steady - state I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 mRNA levels we observed within 30 min of monocyte adherence would result from NF - kappa B - dependent transcriptional stimulation of the I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 gene . Nuclear run - on analyses indicated that , instead , while several immediate - early cytokine genes , such as the interleukin 1 beta ( IL - 1 beta ) gene , were transcriptionally activated during monocyte adhesion , the rate of I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 gene transcription remained constant . The adherence - dependent increase in I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 mRNA levels was also not a consequence of mRNA stabilization events . Interestingly , while increases in both IL - 1 beta and I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 mRNA levels were detected in nuclei of adherent monocytes , cytoplasmic levels of IL - 1 beta mRNA increased during adherence whereas those of I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 mRNA did not . We propose that adherent monocytes regulate nuclear processing ( or decay ) of I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 mRNA , thereby increasing mRNA levels without stimulating I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 gene transcription . Moreover , since inhibition of protein synthesis leads to accumulation of I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 mRNA without stimulating I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 gene transcription , we suggest that low cytoplasmic levels of I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 mRNA are maintained by a translation - dependent degradation mechanism . Distinct roles of the molecular chaperone hsp90 in modulating dioxin receptor function via the basic helix - loop - helix and PAS domains . The intracellular dioxin receptor mediates signal transduction by dioxin and functions as a ligand - activated transcription factor . It contains a basic helix - loop - helix ( bHLH ) motif contiguous with a Per - Arnt - Sim ( PAS ) homology region . We have reconstituted ligand - dependent activation of the receptor to a DNA - binding form by using the dioxin receptor and its bHLH - PAS partner factor Arnt expressed by in vitro translation in reticulocyte lysate . Deletion of the PAS domain of the receptor resulted in constitutive dimerization with Arnt . In contrast , this receptor mutant showed low levels of xenobiotic response element - binding activity , indicating that the PAS domain may be important for DNA - binding affinity and / or specificity of the receptor . At least two distinct domains of the receptor mediated interaction with hsp90 : the ligand - binding domain located within the PAS region and , surprisingly , the bHLH domain . Whereas ligand - binding activity correlated with association with hsp90 , bHLH - hsp90 interaction appeared to be important for DNA - binding activity but not for dimerization of the receptor . Several distinct roles for hsp90 in modulating dioxin receptor function are therefore likely : correct folding of the ligand - binding domain , interference with Arnt heterodimerization , and folding of a DNA - binding conformation of the bHLH domain . Thus , the dioxin receptor system provides a complex and interesting model of the regulation of transcription factors by hsp90 . Aspirin - like drugs ( ALD ) induce calcium mobilization , an essential component of T cell activation , but do not induce the biosynthesis of IL - 2 . To understand the extent to which ALD may mimic mitogenic stimulation , we studied cytoplasmic and nuclear signaling steps in ALD - treated T cells . We found that ALD induce a transient activation of protein kinase ( PKC ) but have no effect ( in comparison to anti - CD3 antibodies ) on protein tyrosine phosphorylation nor on PCL gamma 1 tyrosine phosphorylation . ALD - induced calcium mobilization and PKC activation are independent of tyrosine protein kinase activity as shown by the lack of effect of herbimycin , a tyrosine - protein kinase - specific inhibitor . Although we detected no IL - 2 mRNA in ALD - treated cells , the nuclei of these cells contain proteins capable of binding to three regulatory sequences in the IL - 2 promoter region : NFAT , NF kappa B , and AP - 1 . These binding activities are expressed only in activated T cells . The expression of AP - 1 depended on calcium mobilization and PKC activation . These data suggest that ALD cause transient but significant changes in T cell transmembrane signaling , although some events induced by stimulation with anti - CD3 antibodies are not induced by ALD . The signal is transmitted to the nucleus and induces DNA - binding activity by several transcription factors . However , the ALD stimulus is not capable of causing complete T cell activation . The aim of this present study was to investigate the role of protein kinase C ( PKC ) , downstream of p21ras , in activating interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) gene expression . It has been reported that PKC is an effector of p21ras in T cells . Reporter gene experiments demonstrated that NF - kappa B transcriptional activity is not affected by expression of activated p21ras . The C - terminus of the B cell activator Oct - 2 functions as an activation domain in yeast . Oct - 1 and Oct - 2 are human transcriptional activators that bind to the same DNA element but activate distinct sets of genes . We expressed these factors in S . cerevisiae and observed greater than 5 - fold stimulation of a lacZ reporter gene only with Oct - 2 . Transfer of the Oct - 2 C - terminal domain onto either Oct - 1 ( Oct1 . 2 ) or a nonactivating DNA - binding domain from GAL4 created activators capable of greater than 15 and 10 - fold stimulation of activity , respectively . Thus , the C - terminus of Oct - 2 is sufficient to confer activation potential to nonactive DNA - binding fragments in yeast . Glucocorticoid - induced apoptosis of lymphoid cells . The induction of cell death in lymphoid cells by glucocorticoids is one of the earliest and most thoroughly studied models of apoptosis . Although the exact mechanism by which apoptosis occurs in lymphocytes is unknown many biochemical and molecular changes have been shown to occur in these cells in response to glucocorticoids . The role of chromatin degradation and endonucleases in the apoptotic process has been closely studied , as well as the involvement of several oncogenes in glucocorticoid - induced cell lysis . In addition , the clinical importance of glucocorticoid - induced apoptosis in the treatment of lymphoid neoplasms has recently received increased attention . Interleukin - 2 induces tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of stat3 in human T lymphocytes . An early biochemical event associated with T cell activation through the interleukin - 2 receptor ( IL - 2R ) is tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates . The exact mechanism by which IL - 2 regulates transcription of different genes is presently unknown . In contrast , stat1 proteins were not tyrosine phosphorylated after IL - 2 ligation , whereas tyrosine - phosphorylated stat1 proteins ( 91 and 84 kDa proteins ) were translocated to the nucleus following interferon - gamma treatment of HeLa cells . Since IL - 2 induced nuclear translocation of the 84 kDa protein and stat3 followed identical kinetics , p84 is a candidate for a new , yet undefined , member of the STAT family . Tax acts indirectly by inducing or modifying the action of various host transcription factors , including members of the NF - kappa B / Rel family of enhancer - binding proteins . In resting T cells , many of these NF - kappa B / Rel factors are sequestered in the cytoplasm by various ankyrin - rich inhibitory proteins , including I kappa B alpha . HTLV - I Tax expression leads to the constitutive nuclear expression of biologically active NF - kappa B and c - Rel complexes ; however , the biochemical mechanism ( s ) underlying this response remains poorly understood . In this study , we demonstrate that Tax - stimulated nuclear expression of NF - kappa B in both HTLV - I - infected and Tax - transfected human T cells is associated with the phosphorylation and rapid proteolytic degradation of I kappa B alpha . We further demonstrate that Tax induction of nuclear c - Rel expression is activated by the RelA ( p65 ) subunit of NF - kappa B , which activates transcription of the c - rel gene through an intrinsic kappa B enhancer element . In normal cells , the subsequent accumulation of nuclear c - Rel acts to inhibit its own continued production , indicating the presence of an autoregulatory loop . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) Activation of NF - kappa B in vivo is regulated by multiple phosphorylations . The activation of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF - kappa B ) in intact cells is mechanistically not well understood . In HeLa cells as well as in B cells , TNF - alpha rapidly induced nuclear translocation primarily of p50 - p65 , but not of c - rel . Both NF - kappa B precursors and I kappa B alpha became strongly phosphorylated with the same kinetics . In addition to the inducible phosphorylation after stimulation , B lymphocytes containing constitutive nuclear NF - kappa B revealed constitutively phosphorylated p65 and I kappa B alpha . Phosphorylation was accompanied by induced processing of the precursors p100 and p105 and by degradation of I kappa B alpha . As an in vitro model we show that phosphorylation of p105 impedes its ability to interact with NF - kappa B , as has been shown before for I kappa B alpha . Surprisingly , even p65 , but not c - rel , was phosphorylated after induction in vivo , suggesting that TNF - alpha selectively activates only specific NF - kappa B heteromers and that modifications regulate not only I kappa B molecules but also NF - kappa B molecules . In fact , cellular NF - kappa B activity was phosphorylation - dependent and the DNA binding activity of p65 - containing NF - kappa B was enhanced by phosphorylation in vitro . Furthermore , we found that the induction by hydrogen peroxide of NF - kappa B translocation to the nucleus , which is assumed to be triggered by reactive oxygen intermediates , also coincided with incorporation of phosphate into the same subunits that were modified after stimulation by TNF - alpha . Thus , phosphorylation appears to be a general mechanism for activation of NF - kappa B in vivo . Treatment of HL60 cells with various combinations of retinoids and 1 alpha , 25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 results in differentiation towards neutrophils or monocytes or a failure to differentiate and apoptosis . It is well documented that treatment of serum - grown HL60 cells with 10 ( - 7 ) M all - trans retinoic acid ( all - trans RA ) induces neutrophil differentiation , whereas treatment with 10 ( - 7 ) M 1 alpha , 25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( D3 ) induces differentiation towards monocytes . In recent investigations , using serum - free grown HL60 cells , we observed that all - trans RA , at 10 ( - 7 ) M , did not induce neutrophil differentiation and that all - trans RA , at 10 ( - 8 ) M , reduced the D3 concentration required for monocyte differentiation to 5 x 10 ( - 9 ) M . In this study , co - operative interactions between all - trans and 9 - cis RA and D3 which promote neutrophil and monocyte differentiation of HL60 cells have been analysed in detail . Treatment of serum - free grown HL60 cells with 5 x 10 ( - 7 ) M all - trans RA or 9 - cis RA resulted in sub - optimal neutrophil differentiation ( up to 25 % mature cells ) . As shown for all - trans RA , 9 - cis RA cooperated with D3 to promote monocyte differentiation . Culture of HL60 cells in 5 x 10 ( - 7 ) M 9 - cis RA together with a wide range of concentrations of D3 resulted in promotion of neutrophil differentiation at 10 ( - 15 ) - 10 ( - 12 ) D3 , a failure to differentiate and apoptosis at 10 ( - 11 ) - 10 ( - 10 ) M D3 , followed by co - operativity between 9 - cis RA and 5 x 10 ( - 9 ) M D3 in inducing monocyte differentiation in the absence of neutrophil differentiation . Similar results were obtained when HL60 cells were treated with 5 x 10 ( - 7 ) all - trans RA together with a wide range of concentrations of D3 . Cross titration analyses of the effects of 9 - cis RA and D3 on HL60 cell differentiation were undertaken to determine the boundaries of the concentrations of each agent , alone and in combination , that give rise to optimal neutrophil and monocyte differentiation of HL60 cells . The observed cooperativities between either 9 - cis RA or all - trans RA and D3 have important implications for the use of combinations of these agents in differentiation therapy . Transcriptional control of steroid - regulated gene networks by nuclear receptor proteins results in the coordinate expression of a limited number of target genes . Using this technique we have isolated several differentially expressed sequence tags ( DESTs ) from the mouse thymocyte cell line WEHI 7 . 2 . Two of these DESTs , GIG10 and GIG18 , are rapidly induced by dexamethasone within 2 h of treatment . We also used DDPCR to isolate DESTs from androgen - modulated rat ventral prostate tissue , one of which we characterized and found to correspond to the 3 ' end of prostatic spermine binding protein mRNA , a known androgen - regulated gene . Modifications of the original DDPCR protocol , which we found can potentially decrease the frequency of isolating false - positive DESTs , are described and the merits of DDPCR , relative to other differential cDNA cloning strategies , are discussed . Activation of human thymocytes after infection by EBV . The discovery of EBV in certain T cell malignancies and the expression of the EBV receptor , CR2 / CD21 , on a population of immature thymocytes , T lymphoblastoid cell lines , and childhood acute T lymphoblastic leukemia cells suggested that EBV - receptor interactions on T cells may be of importance . Triggering through CD2 is mitogenic for mature , but not immature , T cells . However , during infection by EBV , ligation of CD2 caused thymocytes to proliferate in the absence of exogenous cytokines . Immature thymocytes were infected by EBV , as determined by the internalization of the viral genome and its transcriptional activity . In addition , components of the viral replicative pathway were expressed during infection of thymocytes . These components included transcription of BZLF - 1 , an early gene that characterizes EBV - infected B cells after disruption of latency . The consequences of EBV infection of T cells at an early stage of differentiation may lead to failure of normal T cell repertoire development , autoimmunity , or malignancy . Effects of intranasal glucocorticoids on endogenous glucocorticoid peripheral and central function . Glucocorticoids are among the most potent antiinflammatory agents that can be used in the treatment of rhinitis . Their mechanisms of action are multiple and complex and a number of reports describe significant systemic effects of locally administered glucocorticoids . In order to evaluate the short - term systemic effects of intranasally administered glucocorticoids , 14 normal healthy subjects were treated with two doses of either budesonide ( BUD ) or fluticasone propionate ( FP ) for 2 weeks . Before treatment , at regular intervals during the treatment , 1 week and finally 6 weeks after termination of treatment , the effects on glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) and methallothionein ( MTIIa ) mRNA expression levels were examined in peripheral lymphocytes using a solution hybridization assay . Serum cortisol , osteocalcin and urinary cortisol levels were also determined . An insulin tolerance test ( ITT ) was performed at the end of the second week of treatment and at the end of the 6 - week washout period with no statistically significant change in cortisol response . In peripheral lymphocytes , GR mRNA levels were significantly down - regulated . MTIIa mRNA levels increased significantly . Serum osteocalcin decreased significantly during treatment with both BUD and FP . Serum cortisol decreased after 1 week of treatment whereas urinary cortisol was not affected until the second week of treatment . In conclusion , intranasal glucocorticoids at clinically recommended doses have not only significant systemic effects on adrenal function , but also have an effect on specific gene expression in peripheral lymphocytes . These effects are receptor - dependent , reversible , and according to serum and urinary cortisol levels and ITT , leave the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal function intact . Finally , these short - term systemic effects were not associated with any of the noticeable side - effects usually observed during long - term treatment with glucocorticoids . Biphasic control of nuclear factor - kappa B activation by the T cell receptor complex : role of tumor necrosis factor alpha . Only p50 NF - kappa B protein bound the kappa B element of interleukin - 2 receptor ( IL - 2R ) alpha chain promoter on resting T cells . However , immediately after TcR / CD3 cross - linking ( after approximately 1 h ; immediate ) binding of p50 . p65 heterodimers was observed . This regulation takes place mainly at the level of nuclear translocation of p65 and c - rel , at immediate and early time points . Activation also induced c - rel and p105 / p50 mRNA synthesis , but not p65 mRNA whose expression was constitutive . Interestingly , all those early and late events , but not the immediate ones , were inhibited by a neutralizing anti - tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - alpha ) monoclonal antibody . Similarly , cycloheximide prevented the p65 and c - rel translocation and consequent formation of active binding heterodimers , at early and late times . Cyclosporin A impaired not only early and late , but also immediate events ; however , addition of TNF - alpha prevented all inhibition . TNF - alpha , therefore , emerges as the main factor responsible for a second phase of NF - kappa B regulation , controlling both translocation of p65 and c - rel , and new mRNA synthesis for c - rel and p105 / p50 . The transcription factor Sp1 is required for induction of the murine GM - CSF promoter in T cells . GM - kappa B defines a binding site for NF - kappa B , and GC - box defines a binding site for three ( A1 , A2 , B ) constitutive proteins . The major GC - box binding activity A1 was purified and identified as the transcription factor Sp1 . We show that depletion of Sp1 ( A1 ) from nuclear extracts specifically decreases in vitro transcription activity on GM - CSF templates . Since the human GM - CSF promoter has a base difference within the GC - box , we speculate that this may explain why the human promoter is weak and that an upstream enhancer is required for the induction of the human GM - CSF gene . A novel DNA sequence element termed the J element involved in the regulated expression of class II major histocompatibility complex genes was recently described . To study this element and its role in class II gene regulation further , a cDNA library was screened with oligonucleotide probes containing both the S element and the nearby J element of the human DPA gene . Several DNA clones were obtained by this procedure , one of which , clone 18 , is reported and characterized here . The 160 N - terminal amino acids in the nonfinger region of clone 18 are highly homologous with similar regions of several other human , mouse , and Drosophila sequences , defining a subfamily of Kruppel - like zinc finger proteins termed TAB ( tramtrack [ ttk ] - associated box ) here . An acidic activation domain is located between the N - terminal conserved region of clone 18 and its zinc fingers . Antisense cDNA to clone 18 inhibited the expression of a reporter construct containing the DPA promoter , indicating its functional importance in the expression of this class II gene . Separation of oxidant - initiated and redox - regulated steps in the NF - kappa B signal transduction pathway . Studies presented here show that overall NF - kappa B signal transduction begins with a parallel series of stimuli - specific pathways through which cytokines ( tumor necrosis factor alpha ) , oxidants ( hydrogen peroxide and mitomycin C ) , and phorbol ester ( phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ) individually initiate signaling . We distinguish the stimuli - specific pathways by showing that the oxidative stimuli trigger NF - kappa B activation in only one of two human T - cell lines ( Wurzburg but not Jurkat ) , whereas tumor necrosis factor alpha and phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate readily stimulate in both lines . We propose the common pathway as the simplest way of accounting for the common requirements and properties of the signaling pathway . We include a redox - regulatory mechanism ( s ) in this common pathway to account for the previously demonstrated redox regulation of NF - kappa B activation in Jurkat cells ( in which oxidants do n ' t activate NF - kappa B ) ; we put tyrosine phosphorylation in the common pathway by showing that kinase activity ( inhibitable by herbimycin A and tyrphostin 47 ) is required for NF - kappa B activation by all stimuli tested in both cell lines . Since internal sites of oxidant production have been shown to play a key role in the cytokine - stimulated activation of NF - kappa B , and since tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activities are known to be altered by oxidants , these findings suggest that intracellular redox status controls NF - kappa B activation by regulating tyrosine phosphorylation event ( s ) within the common step of the NF - kappa B signal transduction pathway . Deleted chromosome 20 from a patient with Alagille syndrome isolated in a cell hybrid through leucine transport selection : study of three candidate genes . Alagille syndrome ( AGS ) is a well - defined genetic entity assigned to the short arm of Chromosome ( Chr ) 20 by a series of observations of AGS patients associated with microdeletions in this region . By fusing lymphoblastoid cells of an AGS patient that exhibited a microdeletion in the short arm of Chr 20 encompassing bands p11 . 23 to p12 . 3 with rodent thermosensitive mutant cells ( CHOtsH1 - 1 ) deficient in - leucyl - tRNA synthetase , we isolated a somatic cell hybrid segregating the deleted human Chr 20 . This hybrid clone , designated NR2 , was characterized by several methods , including PCR , with eight pairs of oligonucleotides mapped to Chr 20 : D20S5 , D20S41 , D20S42 , D20S56 , D20S57 , D20S58 , adenosine deaminase ( ADA ) , and Prion protein ( PRIP ) ; Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism ( RFLP ) analyses with four genomic anonymous probes ( D20S5 , cD3H12 , D20S17 , D20S18 ) ; and fluorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ) with total human DNA and D20Z1 , a sequence specific to the human Chr 20 centromere , as probes . The NR2 hybrid allowed us to exclude three candidate genes for AGS : hepatic nuclear factor 3 beta ( HNF3 beta ) , paired box 1 ( PAX1 ) , and cystatin C ( CST3 ) as shown by their localization outside of the deletion . The NR2 hybrid is a powerful tool for the mapping of new probes of this region , as well as for obtaining new informative probes specific for the deletion by subtractive cloning of the region . Such markers will be useful for linkage analysis and screening of cDNA libraries . Positive and negative regulation of the composite octamer motif of the interleukin 2 enhancer by AP - 1 , Oct - 2 , and retinoic acid receptor . The differentiating agent retinoic acid ( RA ) has been previously reported to interfere with 12 - O - tetradecanoyl - phorbol - 13 - acetate ( TPA ) / Ca ( 2 + ) - induced signals for the regulation of the - 96 to - 66 - bp octamer motif found in the enhancer for the interleukin ( IL ) - 2 gene , which encodes a major T lymphocyte growth factor . The IL - 2 octamer motif is a composite cis - element which binds Oct - 1 and Oct - 2 as well as a TPA / Ca ( 2 + ) - inducible nuclear factor , previously termed octamer - associated protein ( OAP40 ) . We show here that Oct - 2 , despite the presence of an active transcriptional activation domain , requires TPA / Ca ( 2 + ) - induced signals to strongly transactivate the IL - 2 octamer motif in Jurkat T cells . The presence of an intact COOH - terminal domain of Oct - 2 contributes to both TPA / Ca ( 2 + ) - induced transactivation and the RA - mediated repression . Furthermore , transfected c - jun , jun - B , jun - D , c - fos , or Fos - B expression vectors partially substitute for TPA and Ca2 + and cooperate with Oct - 2 for the transactivation of the combined OAP / octamer cis - element . Mutations of the genuine octamer - binding site abrogate both the binding of Oct - 1 and Oct - 2 and the TPA / Ca ( 2 + ) - induced transactivation of the OAP / octamer motif . Furthermore , retinoic acid receptor ( RAR ) alpha is able to inhibit in vitro the formation of the complex between the nuclear AP - 1 / OAP and its specific binding site , resulting in the interference with Oct - 2 - dependent cis - regulatory function of this AP - 1 element . Missense mutation in exon 7 of the common gamma chain gene causes a moderate form of X - linked combined immunodeficiency . Clinical and immunologic features of a recently recognized X - linked combined immunodeficiency disease ( XCID ) suggested that XCID and X - linked severe combined immunodeficiency ( XSCID ) might arise from different genetic defects . The recent discovery of mutations in the common gamma chain ( gamma c ) gene , a constituent of several cytokine receptors , in XSCID provided an opportunity to test directly whether a previously unrecognized mutation in this same gene was responsible for XCID . The status of X chromosome inactivation in blood leukocytes from obligate carriers of XCID was determined from the polymorphic , short tandem repeats ( CAG ) , in the androgen receptor gene , which also contains a methylation - sensitive HpaII site . In addition , X chromosome inactivation in PMNs was variable . Findings from this analysis prompted sequencing of the gamma c gene in this pedigree . A missense mutation in the region coding for the cytoplasmic portion of the gamma c gene was found in three affected males but not in a normal brother . Therefore , this point mutation in the gamma c gene leads to a less severe degree of deficiency in cellular and humoral immunity than that seen in XSCID . Posttranscriptional regulation of macrophage tissue factor expression by antioxidants . Tissue factor ( TF ) expression by cells of monocyte / macrophage lineage represents an important mechanism underlying the initiation of fibrin deposition at sites of extravascular inflammation . Recent evidence suggests a role for oxidant stress in the signalling pathway of various cell types by virtue of its ability to induce DNA binding of various transcription factors , including nuclear factor kappa B and AP - 1 . The effect of antioxidant treatment on lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - induced TF expression was examined in murine peritoneal macrophages and human monocytes . Northern blot analysis showed that neither of these agents reduced LPS - stimulated TF mRNA accumulation , thereby suggesting a posttranscriptional mechanism for the effect . Immunofluorescence studies of human monocytes using polyclonal anti - TF antibody showed that N - acetyl - cysteine treatment prevented the characteristic plasmalemmal localization of TF antigen that occurs in response to LPS . Western blot analysis showed that N - acetyl - cysteine reduced the accumulation of the 47 - kD mature glycoprotein in LPS - treated cells , a finding consistent with the results of the immunofluorescence studies . Furthermore , these conditions did not result in an accumulation of the less mature forms of TF . When considered together , these data suggest that antioxidants exert their effects by impairing translation and / or by causing degradation of newly translated protein . The effect of antioxidants on tumor necrosis factor appeared to be species specific , with no effect on LPS - induced tumor necrosis factor in murine cells , but with inhibition in human monocytes . The posttranscriptional effect of antioxidants on TF expression data suggests a novel mechanism whereby these agents might modulate monocyte / macrophage activation . Characterization of the CD48 gene demonstrates a positive element that is specific to Epstein - Barr virus - immortalized B - cell lines and contains an essential NF - kappa B site . Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) infection of mature , resting B cells drives them to become lymphoblasts expressing high levels of cell surface molecules , such as CD48 , characteristically expressed on normal activated B cells . Here , we report on the identification of an enhancer element in the CD48 gene which reproducibly confers strong transcriptional activity only in EBV - positive B - lymphoblastoid cell lines . The element is not activated upon infection of established EBV - negative B - cell lines , indicating that EBV fails to drive these cells to a fully lymphoblastoid phenotype . We have detected a specific nuclear protein complex that binds to the element and show that NF - kappa B1 ( p50 ) is a part of this complex . The EBV - encoded latent membrane protein 1 is capable of transactivating the isolated CD48 NF - kappa B site but not the intact element , suggesting that the latent membrane protein 1 - driven activation of NF - kappa B / Rel must interact with other regulatory pathways to control expression of cellular genes as EBV drives resting B cells into the cell cycle . Thapsigargin induces IL - 2 receptor alpha - chain in human peripheral and Jurkat T cells via a protein kinase C - independent mechanism . TG plus phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) but not TG alone induced IL - 2 in Jurkat T cells , suggesting that TG had no effect on protein kinase C ( PKC ) . However , TG induced increases in IL - 2R alpha protein as well as IL - 2R alpha mRNA in Jurkat T cells in a dose - dependent manner . Further , like PMA , TG markedly induced NF kappa B in Jurkat T cells . In toto , these results suggest that TG induces IL - 2R alpha in human T cells through a PKC - independent pathway . Physiological concentration of estradiol inhibits polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis via a receptor mediated system . Estrogen exhibits a variety of actions , including immuno - modulatory effects , in vivo and in vitro . The mechanism by which estrogen exerts its anti - inflammatory effect is not yet understood . We investigated the possible mechanisms of estradiol acting via the polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( PMNs ) , which are important in the immune response . These observations suggest that 17 beta - estradiol suppressed the chemotaxis of PMNs by a receptor - dependent mechanism . Estrogen may modify the activity of neutrophils during the normal menstrual cycle , not only during pregnancy , and influence inflammation . Identification of the TCL1 gene involved in T - cell malignancies . The TCL1 locus on chromosome 14q32 . 1 is frequently involved in chromosomal translocations and inversions with one of the T - cell receptor loci in human T - cell leukemias and lymphomas . The chromosome 14 region translocated or rearranged involves approximately 350 kb of DNA at chromosome band 14q32 . 1 . Within this region we have identified a gene coding for a 1 . 3 - kb transcript , expressed only in restricted subsets of cells within the lymphoid lineage and expressed at high levels in leukemic cells carrying a t ( 14 ; 14 ) ( q11 ; q32 ) chromosome translocation or a inv ( 14 ) ( q11 ; q32 ) chromosome inversion . The cognate cDNA sequence reveals an open reading frame of 342 nt encoding a protein of 14 kDa . The TCL1 gene sequence , which , to our knowledge , shows no sequence homology with other human genes , is preferentially expressed early in T - and B - lymphocyte differentiation . Identification of a region which directs the monocytic activity of the colony - stimulating factor 1 ( macrophage colony - stimulating factor ) receptor promoter and binds PEBP2 / CBF ( AML1 ) . The receptor for the macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( or colony - stimulating factor 1 [ CSF - 1 ] ) is expressed from different promoters in monocytic cells and placental trophoblasts . We have demonstrated that the monocyte - specific expression of the CSF - 1 receptor is regulated at the level of transcription by a tissue - specific promoter whose activity is stimulated by the monocyte / B - cell - specific transcription factor PU . 1 ( D . - E . Zhang , C . J . Hetherington , H . - M . Chen , and D . G . Tenen , Mol . Cell . Biol . 14 : 373 - 381 , 1994 ) . Here we report that the tissue specificity of this promoter is also mediated by sequences in a region II ( bp - 88 to - 59 ) , which lies 10 bp upstream from the PU . 1 - binding site . When analyzed by DNase footprinting , region II was protected preferentially in monocytic cells . Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that region II interacts specifically with nuclear proteins from monocytic cells . Competition and supershift experiments indicate that Mono B contains a member of the polyomavirus enhancer - binding protein 2 / core - binding factor ( PEBP2 / CBF ) family , which includes the AML1 gene product , while Mono A is a distinct complex preferentially expressed in monocytic cells . Promoter constructs with mutations in these sequence elements were no longer expressed specifically in monocytes . These results indicate that the monocyte / B - cell - specific transcription factor PU . 1 and the Mono A and Mono B protein complexes act in concert to regulate monocyte - specific transcription of the CSF - 1 receptor . We examined the effect of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) , which potently blocks the activation of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF - kappa B ) , on the induction of apoptosis by a variety of agents . Treatment of a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line , HL - 60 , with 10 micrograms / mL etoposide or 2 microM 1 - beta - D - arabinofuranosylcyto induced NF - kappa B activation within 1 hr and subsequently caused apoptosis within 3 - 4 hr . The simultaneous addition of 50 - 500 microM PDTC with these agents blocked NF - kappa B activation and completely abrogated both morphologically apoptotic changes and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation for up to 6 hr . The inhibitory effect of PDTC was also observed in etoposide - and dexamethasone - induced apoptosis in human thymocytes at a concentration of 1 - 10 microM . Pretreatment of HL - 60 cells or thymocytes with 100 - 500 microM OP for 2 hr , but not 10 - 60 mM NAC , suppressed subsequent occurrence of apoptosis induced by etoposide . These results suggest that the activation of NF - kappa B plays an important role in the apoptotic process of human hematopoietic cells . Overexpression of protein kinase C - zeta stimulates leukemic cell differentiation . A function for protein kinase C - zeta ( PKC - zeta ) , a member of the phorbol ester nonresponsive atypical protein kinase C subfamily , in modulating differentiation was examined in the leukemic U937 cell . Transfected U937 cells stably overexpressing PKC - zeta displayed a longer doubling time , lower saturation density at confluency , and an increase in adherence to plastic as compared to control cells . In contrast to parental U937 cells , PKC - zeta cells constitutively expressed mRNA transcripts for c - jun and a low mobility AP - 1 binding activity . Thus , PKC - zeta overexpression stimulates a type of phenotypic differentiation that differs significantly from maturation occurring upon activation of other PKC subfamilies induced by phorbol ester treatment . A family of serine proteases expressed exclusively in myelo - monocytic cells specifically processes the nuclear factor - kappa B subunit p65 in vitro and may impair human immunodeficiency virus replication in these cells . Two groups of U937 promonocytic cells were obtained by limiting dilution cloning which differed strikingly in their ability to support human immunodeficiency virus 1 ( HIV - 1 ) replication . ` ` Plus ' ' clones replicated the virus efficiently , whereas ` ` minus ' ' clones did not . We examined these clones for differences in nuclear factor ( NF ) - kappa B activity which might account for the observed phenomenon . Stimulation of plus clones liberated the classical p50 - p65 complex from cytoplasmic pools , whereas minus clones produced an apparently novel , faster - migrating complex , as judged by electrophoretic mobility shift assays . However , the p65 subunit was COOH - terminally truncated , as shown by immunoprecipitation . The truncation resulted from limited proteolysis of p65 during cellular extraction which released particular lysosomal serine proteases , such as elastase , cathepsin G , and proteinase 3 . These specific proteases are coordinately expressed and were present exclusively in the minus U937 clones , but not in the plus clones , as demonstrated in the case of cathepsin G . In addition , these proteases were detected in certain subclones of THP - 1 and HL - 60 cells and in primary monocytes , in each case correlating with the truncated from of p65 . We demonstrate in vitro cleavage of p65 by purified elastase and cathepsin G . It is possible that particular serine proteases may have inhibiting effects on the replication of HIV - 1 in myelo - monocytic cells . The data also demonstrate that special precautions must be taken when making extracts from myelo - monocytic cells . A germline TaqI restriction fragment length polymorphism in the progesterone receptor gene in ovarian carcinoma [ see comments ] Clinical outcome in ovarian carcinoma is predicted by progesterone receptor status , indicating an endocrine aspect to this disease . Peripheral leucocyte genomic DNAs were obtained from 41 patients with primary ovarian carcinoma and 83 controls from Ireland , as well as from 26 primary ovarian carcinoma patients and 101 controls in Germany . Southern analysis using a human progesterone receptor ( hPR ) cDNA probe identified a germline TaqI restriction fragment length polymorphism ( RFLP ) defined by two alleles : T1 , represented by a 2 . 7 kb fragment ; and T2 , represented by a 1 . 9 kb fragment and characterised by an additional TaqI restriction site with respect to T1 . An over - representation of T2 in ovarian cancer patients compared with controls in the pooled Irish / German population ( P < 0 . 025 ) was observed . A difference ( P < 0 . 02 ) in the distribution of the RFLP genotypes between Irish and German control populations was also observed . The allele distributions could not be shown to differ significantly from Hardy - Weinberg distribution in any subgroup . Using hPR cDNA region - specific probes , the extra TaqI restriction site was mapped to intron G of the hPR gene . Recent biochemical and genetic studies indicate that in addition to the octamer - binding proteins Oct - 1 and Oct - 2 , other B cell components are required for lymphoid - restricted , octamer site - mediated immunoglobulin gene promoter activity . Using a genetic screen in yeast , we have isolated B cell - derived cDNAs encoding Oct - binding factor 1 ( OBF - 1 ) , a novel protein that specifically associates with Oct - 1 and Oct - 2 . Biochemical studies demonstrate that OBF - 1 has no intrinsic DNA - binding activity and recognizes the POU domains of Oct - 1 and Oct - 2 , but not those of Oct - 4 and Oct - 6 . Furthermore , expression of OBF - 1 in HeLa cells selectively stimulates the activity of a natural immunoglobulin promoter in an octamer site - dependent manner . Thus , OBF - 1 has all the properties expected for a B cell - specific transcriptional coactivator protein . Modulation of transcription factor NF kappa B activity by intracellular glutathione levels and by variations of the extracellular cysteine supply . HIV - infected individuals and SIV - infected rhesus macaques have , on the average , decreased plasma cysteine and cystine concentrations and decreased intracellular glutathione levels . We now show that a depletion of intracellular glutathione in a human T cell line ( Molt - 4 ) inhibits the activation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF kappa B , whereas incubation with increasing extracellular concentrations of cysteine inhibits the DNA - binding and transactivating activity of NF kappa B . Because inhibition of DNA - binding activity is associated with increasing intracellular glutathione disulfide levels and GSSG can be shown to inhibit the DNA - binding activity directly in cell - free systems , our studies suggest that GSSG is a physiologically relevant inhibitor in intact cells also . NF kappa B controls many immunologically important genes , so our studies suggest that the immune system may be sensitive not only against a cysteine and glutathione deficiency but also against an excess of cysteine . Two distinct signalling pathways are involved in the control of the biphasic junB transcription induced by interleukin - 6 in the B cell hybridoma 7TD1 . We have measured the level of junB mRNA in the B hybridoma cell line 7TD1 , under interleukin - 6 ( IL - 6 ) stimulation . IL - 6 increases junB mRNA in a biphasic fashion . At variance , the second peak which has never been reported previously , lasted several hours . As a consequence of its effect on junB mRNA , IL - 6 stimulated , in a biphasic fashion , the nuclear accumulation of the JunB protein . In this study , we demonstrated that IL - 6 regulation occurred exclusively at the transcriptional level and that the bimodal increase of junB mRNA and JunB protein can be accounted for by a biphasic stimulation of junB transcription . Furthermore , our data point to two major differences between the mechanism of control of the early and the late IL - 6 - induced junB transcription waves . First , cycloheximide strongly potentiated the transcription of the second wave , whereas it failed to affect the early - induced burst . Conversely , genistein , another tyrosine kinase inhibitor , totally abolished the expression of the second peak of junB mRNA whereas it did not affect the expression of the first peak . Altogether these data indicate that , in 7TD1 cells , IL - 6 controls junB transcription in a biphasic fashion by means of two separate transduction pathways . A newly established megakaryoblastic / erythroid cell line that differentiates to red cells in the presence of erythropoietin and produces platelet - like particles . In August , 1992 , we established a leukemic cell line ( NS - Meg ) from a patient in megakaryoblastic transformation of Philadelphia chromosome - positive chronic myeloid leukemia . The NS - Meg cells were positive for alpha - naphthyl acetate esterase and periodic acid - Schiff ( PAS ) staining and for surface CD4 , CD7 , CD13 , CD34 , CD41a , and glycophorin A antigens . Ultrastructurally , the cells had alpha - granules , demarcation membranes , and platelet peroxidase activity . The NS - Meg cells spontaneously produced platelet - like particles which contained alpha - granules , mitochondria and dense bodies , strongly suggesting platelet production . Phorbol - 12 - myristate - 13 - acetate increased the expression of both CD41a and CD61 antigens . Untreated NS - Meg cells expressed mRNA for the Epo receptor ( EpoR ) , for GATA - 1 , and for alpha 1 , alpha 2 and gamma globin genes . These results indicate that NS - Meg cells undergo terminal differentiation of both megakaryocytic and erythroid lineages . This cell line should be a very useful tool for the investigation of both megakaryocytic and erythroid maturation . Differential regulation of proto - oncogenes c - jun and c - fos in T lymphocytes activated through CD28 . In addition to activation of phospholipase C gamma 1 , ligation of this receptor also seems to activate a calcium - independent , CD28 - specific pathway . In this paper , we report that cross - linking of CD28 ( but not CD2 , CD5 , LFA - 1 , or CD7 ) leads to an elevation of c - jun mRNA , with only minimal activation of c - fos expression . CD28 - dependent induction of c - jun expression requires protein tyrosine kinase activity , but does not depend on activation of a phorbol ester - responsive protein kinase C or elevation of cytosolic calcium . Furthermore , CD28 - dependent elevation of c - jun mRNA does not appear to be mediated at the level of mRNA stability . A mechanism is suggested whereby expression of c - jun and junB , in the absence of members of the fos family , can prevent inappropriate activation of T cells caused by ligation of CD28 in the absence of a specific antigenic stimulus . Infection with a variant of simian immunodeficiency virus , SIVsmmPBj14 , leads to severe acute disease in macaques . This study was designed to investigate the functional significance of previously described mutations in the viral long terminal repeat ( LTR ) and to elucidate their contribution to the unique phenotype of SIVsmmPBj14 . LTR - directed transcription was measured by using luciferase reporter constructs that were transiently transfected into cultured cells . These LTRs differ by five point mutations and a 22 - bp duplication in SIVsmmPBj14 , which includes a nuclear factor kappa B ( NF kappa B ) site . Transcriptional differences between these LTRs were further enhanced by two - to threefold upon treatment of cells with phorbol ester or tumor necrosis factor alpha or by cotransfection with plasmids expressing NF kappa B subunits . Finally , infectious virus stocks that were isogenic except for the LTR were generated . The LTR from SIVsmmPBj14 was found to confer an increase in the kinetics of virus replication in cultured cells . Inclusion of this LTR in recombinant SIVs also resulted in a two - to threefold rise in the extent of cellular proliferation that was induced in quiescent simian peripheral blood mononuclear cells . These studies are consistent with the hypothesis that LTR mutations assist SIVsmmPBj14 in responding efficiently to cellular stimulation and allow it to replicate to high titers during the acute phase of viral infection . Constitutive nuclear NF - kappa B in cells of the monocyte lineage . In monocytes , the nuclear factor NF - kappa B has been invoked as an important transcription factor in the expression of cytokine genes , of cell - surface receptors and in the expression of human immunodeficiency virus . In our studies , cells of the human monocytic line Mono Mac 6 , cultured in medium containing fetal - calf serum and low levels of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , also exhibit such ' constitutive ' NF - kappa B , as demonstrated by mobility - shift analysis of nuclear extracts . Protein - DNA complexes of constitutive NF - kappa B are similar in mobility to the LPS - induced NF - kappa B and both are recognized by an antibody specific to the p50 subunit of NF - kappa B . By contrast , treatment of cells with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) will only block LPS - induced NF - kappa B , but not the constitutive binding protein . When ordered according to stage of maturation , the amount of constitutive NF - kappa B was not increased in more mature cell lines . Furthermore , when inducing differentiation in Mono Mac 6 cells , with vitamin D3 , no change in constitutive or inducible NF - kappa B can be detected . Analysis of primary cells revealed substantial constitutive NF - kappa B - binding activity in blood monocytes , pleural macrophages and alveolar macrophages . The level of constitutive NF - kappa B in these cells is variable and is frequently found to be lower in the more mature macrophages . Constitutive NF - kappa B was not maintained by autocrine action of cytokines TNF , interleukin 6 , interleukin 10 , granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor or macrophage colony - stimulating factor , since neutralizing antibodies did not reduce constitutive DNA - binding activity . Furthermore , blockade of prostaglandin or leukotriene biosynthesis did not affect constitutive NF - kappa B . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS ) Steel factor affects SCL expression during normal erythroid differentiation . Steel factor is one of the growth factors that controls the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells and SCL , also known as Tcl - 5 or Tal - 1 , is a transcription factor involved in erythropoiesis . In this report , we studied the role of SCL in the proliferation of human peripheral blood burst - forming unit - erythroid ( BFU - E ) and the effects of Steel factor on SCL expression in proliferating erythroid cells . BFU - E - derived colonies increase progressively in size , as determined by cell number , from day 7 to day 14 of culture , with the greatest increase in colony size ( 10 - fold expansion ) occurring between day 7 and day 10 . SCL protein levels in BFU - E - derived cells were highest in day 7 cells and decreased progressively from day 7 to day 14 of culture , suggesting an association of SCL with erythroid proliferation . The role of SCL in Steel factor - induced erythroid proliferation was then examined . In day 7 and day 10 erythroid precursors cultured with Steel factor , SCL protein was increased significantly compared to control . The increase in SCL protein levels in early erythroid precursors stimulated with Steel factor suggests one mechanism through which Steel factor may enhance normal erythroid proliferation . SCL mRNA levels assessed by Northern blot in day 7 cells did not increase significantly in response to Steel factor stimulation , suggesting that posttranscriptional mechanisms may also be important in the increase in SCL protein observed in response to Steel . C / EBP beta regulation of the tumor necrosis factor alpha gene . The mechanism ( s ) responsible for the cell type - specific regulation of TNF alpha is not known . C / EBP beta activated the TNF alpha gene promoter in cotransfection assays and bound to it at a site which failed to bind the closely related protein C / EBP alpha . Finally , a dominant - negative version of C / EBP beta blocked TNF alpha promoter activation in myeloid cells . Our results implicate C / EBP beta as an important regulator of TNF alpha by myelomonocytic cells . Engagement of the T cell receptor for antigen activates phospholipase C resulting in an increase in intracellular free calcium concentration ( [ Ca2 + ] i ) and activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) . Increased [ Ca2 + ] i activates Ca2 + / calmodulin - dependent kinases including the multifunctional Ca2 + / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase II ( CaM - K II ) , as well as calcineurin , a type 2B protein phosphatase . Recent studies have identified calcineurin as a key enzyme for interleukin ( IL ) - 2 and IL - 4 promoter activation . gamma B * CaM - K and delta CaM - AI , known to exhibit constitutive Ca ( 2 + ) - independent activity , were cotransfected ( alone or in combination ) in Jurkat T cells with a plasmid containing the intact IL - 2 promoter driving the expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene . Cotransfection of gamma B * CaM - K with the IL - 2 promoter construct downregulated its transcription in response to stimulation with ionomycin and phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) . The inhibitory effect of CaM - K II on IL - 2 promoter was associated with decreased transcription of its AP - 1 and NF - AT transactivating pathways . Under the same conditions , delta CaM - AI superinduced IL - 2 promoter activity ( approximately twofold increase ) . gamma B * CaM - K also downregulated the activation of AP - 1 in response to transfection with a constitutively active mutant of PKC or stimulation with PMA . These results suggest that CaM - K II may exert negative influences on cytokine gene transcription in human T cells , and provide preliminary evidence for negative cross - talk with the calcineurin - and PKC - dependent signaling systems . Induction of ICAM - 1 and LFA - 3 by Tax1 of human T - cell leukemia virus type 1 and mechanism of down - regulation of ICAM - 1 or LFA - 1 in adult - T - cell - leukemia cell lines . The present study was undertaken to determine the role of HTLV - I TaxI in the up - regulation of ICAM - I and LFA - 3 in human T cells transformed with HTLV - I and the mechanism of down - regulation of ICAM - I and LFA - I in ATL - derived cell lines . The response of LFA - 3 to TaxI induction was , on the other hand , relatively slow and weak , and might be indirect . Transactivation of the ICAM - I promoter by TaxI was further shown by co - transfection of a CAT reporter construct with the ICAM - I promoter and a plasmid expressing TaxI . The mechanism of down - regulation of ICAM - I or LFA - I in 4 ATL cell lines was next examined . ICAM - I mRNA was quite low in MT - I , but no genomic changes were found . The CAT reporter with the ICAM - I promoter was inactive in MT - I . Finally , combined treatment of MT - I with 5 - azacytidine and IFN - gamma induced re - expression of ICAM - I . Collectively , ( a ) transcriptional factor ( s ) necessary for expression of ICAM - I gene may be repressed in MT - I through DNA methylation . No genomic changes were found , and a CAT reporter gene with the CD18 promoter was inactive in the 3 of them , again suggesting lack of ( a ) transcriptional factor ( s ) necessary for CD18 expression . Theileria annulata infects bovine leucocytes and results in their reversible transformation such that they become immortalised and metastatic . The present study describes parasite - induced changes in host cell gene expression which have a direct bearing on this transformation process . An antiserum to this enzyme was used to isolate a cDNA clone . The predicted protein sequence of B1 is 81 % identical to human matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP9 ) , demonstrating that it is the bovine homologue of this enzyme . RNAase protection assays demonstrated that the MMP9 activity , unique to infected cells , is due to increased MMP9 mRNA levels . We also assayed the levels of transcription factor AP - 1 and demonstrated that it was constitutively present in increased amounts in Theileria - infected cells . Since AP - 1 is implicated in the control of the cell cycle , and MMP9 can confer metastatic properties , these results are of considerable significance with respect to the transformed phenotype induced by Theileria infection . B - cell proliferation and induction of early G1 - regulating proteins by Epstein - Barr virus mutants conditional for EBNA2 . Infection of primary B - lymphocytes by Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) leads to growth transformation of these B - cells in vitro . EBV nuclear antigen 2 ( EBNA2 ) , one of the first genes expressed after EBV infection of B - cells , is a transcriptional activator of viral and cellular genes and is essential for the transforming potential of the virus . Growth transformation of primary normal B - cells by mutant virus resulted in estrogen - dependent lymphoblastoid cell lines expressing the chimeric EBNA2 protein . In the absence of estrogen about half of the cells enter a quiescent non - proliferative state whereas the others die by apoptosis . EBNA2 is thus required not only for initiation but also for maintenance of transformation . Growth arrest occurred at G1 and G2 stages of the cell cycle , indicating that functional EBNA2 is required at different restriction points of the cell cycle . Growth arrest is reversible for G1 / G0 cells as indicated by the sequential accumulation and modification of cell cycle regulating proteins . EBV induces the same cell cycle regulating proteins as polyclonal stimuli in primary B - cells . IL - 1 receptor and TCR signals synergize to activate NF - kappa B - mediated gene transcription . Previous studies have demonstrated that IL - 1 receptor ( IL - 1R ) - and TCR - initiated signals can interact synergistically to increase the rate of transcription of several lymphokine and lymphokine receptor genes during the competence phase of the activation program in T helper lymphocytes . In this report we describe how signals initiated through the type I IL - 1R interact with signals from the antigen receptor to synergistically augment the transactivating properties of NF - kappa B . Gel shift analyses demonstrate that NF - kappa B nuclear translocation is stimulated primarily by IL - 1 rather than by antigen receptor signals . Western blot and phosphorylation analyses demonstrate that the synergistic effect on NF - kappa B functional activity is independent of I kappa B alpha ( MAD3 ) - NF - kappa B dissociation in the cytosol and is not associated with I kappa B nuclear translocation . These results suggest that IL - 1 induces both NF - kappa B nuclear translocation and the synthesis of a protein ( s ) responsible for terminating NF - kappa B - DNA interaction in the nucleus . Antigen receptor signals prolong NF - kappa B - DNA interaction , probably by functionally antagonizing the IL - 1 - induced synthesis of a protein ( s ) responsible for the transient NF - kappa B - DNA interaction and consequently synergistically enhance IL - 1 - induced NF - kappa B - dependent gene transcription . Identification of the promoter region of chicken anemia virus ( CAV ) containing a novel enhancer - like element . The single promoter region in the cloned genome [ Noteborn et al . , J . Virol . 65 ( 1991 ) 3131 - 3139 ] of chicken anemia virus ( CAV ) in chicken T - cells was analysed via CAT assays . A unique region containing four or five near - perfect direct repeats ( DR ) of 21 bp with one 12 - bp insert was proven to be the main transcription - activation element , with enhancer - like characteristics . PCR studies revealed that CAV isolates from across the world all contained this promoter sequence . Electrophoretic mobility - shift assays ( EMSA ) showed that individual DR units , as well as the 12 - bp insert , can bind to nuclear factors of chicken T - cells . Competition assays revealed that the DR units bound to factors other than the 12 - bp insert . Purified human SP1 was shown to have very strong affinity for the 12 - bp insert . Previous studies using antisense oligonucleotides implicated the c - Myc protein in the phenomenon of activation - induced apoptosis . This role for c - Myc in apoptosis is now confirmed in studies using a dominant negative form of its heterodimeric binding partner , Max , which we show here inhibits activation - induced apoptosis . Further , coexpression of a reciprocally mutant Myc protein capable of forming functional heterodimers with the mutant Max can compensate for the dominant negative activity and restore activation - induced apoptosis . These results imply that Myc promotes activation - induced apoptosis by obligatory heterodimerization with Max , and therefore , by regulating gene transcription . Epstein - Barr virus SM protein . The protein products of the Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) BMLF1 open reading frame have been characterized in the early productive cycle in B95 - 8 and Akata cells . The SM protein derived from the spliced RNA joining BSLF2 to BMLF1 is much the most abundant protein . SM is a phosphoprotein in EBV - infected cells and can be phosphorylated in vitro with casein kinase II ( CKII ) . Site - directed mutagenesis of the consensus CKII site in EBV SM greatly reduced the in vitro phosphorylation of SM by CKII . The mechanism of transactivation by BMLF1 proteins has been controversial but SM was shown to transactivate gene expression from a CAT reporter construct by increasing the amount of cytoplasmic CAT mRNA . Inducible binding to the c - fos serum response element during T cell activation is regulated by a phosphotyrosine - containing protein . Fos expression may be a pivotal event in converting ligand - receptor interactions at the membrane into functional modulation of cell phenotype . We show that an inducible protein complex ( Band A ) binds to SRE DNA within 10 min after mitogenic stimulation of human PBL - T , and becomes nondetectable by 60 min . A protein that is phosphorylated on a tyrosine residue in resting PBL - T suppresses binding of a component of Band A to the SRE motif . Upon stimulation of the cells , this protein no longer prevents binding of DNA by Band A , and suppression of binding is restored within 30 min . In vivo modification of major histocompatibility complex class II DRA promoter occupancy mediated by the AIR - 1 trans - activator . This locus encodes a transcriptional trans - activator required for the constitutive expression of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II genes . Here we show , by in vivo DNase I footprinting , that the AIR - 1 locus defect correlates with changes in the DRA promoter occupancy . Interestingly , reexpression of human MHC class II genes in RJ 2 . 2 . 5 x mouse spleen cell hybrids is associated with partial reversion of DRA promoter occupancy to the Raji pattern . DRA promoter occupancy in other class II - negative B cell lines , derived from patients with bare lymphocyte syndrome , is drastically different from the one observed in RJ 2 . 2 . 5 and Raji cells . Moreover , the use of the DNase I as an in vivo footprinting agent reveals that the patients ' cell lines do not display a completely ` ` bare promoter ` ` as previously reported using dimethyl sulfate as the footprinting agent . Regulation of cell - type - specific interleukin - 2 receptor alpha - chain gene expression : potential role of physical interactions between Elf - 1 , HMG - I ( Y ) , and NF - kappa B family proteins . Previously , an inducible enhancer between nucleotides - 299 and - 228 that contains NF - kappa B and CArG motifs was identified . We now report the characterization of a second essential positive regulatory element located between nucleotides - 137 and - 64 that binds Elf - 1 and HMG - I ( Y ) . Transcription from the IL - 2R alpha promoter was inhibited when either the Elf - 1 or the HMG - I ( Y ) binding site was mutated . Coexpression of both proteins activated transcription of the - 137 to - 64 element in COS - 7 cells . This is the first report of a physical interaction between an Ets family member and NF - kappa B family proteins . These findings provide significant new insights into the protein - protein and protein - DNA interactions that regulate cell - type - specific and inducible IL - 2R alpha gene expression and also have implications for other genes regulated by Elf - 1 and NF - kappa B family proteins . Isolation of cDNA clones for 42 different Kruppel - related zinc finger proteins expressed in the human monoblast cell line U - 937 . To study the complexity and structural characteristics of zinc finger proteins expressed during human hematopoiesis and to isolate novel regulators of blood cell development , a degenerate oligonucleotide probe specific for a consensus zinc finger peptide domain was used to isolate 63 cDNA clones for Kruppel - related zinc finger genes from the human monoblast cell line U - 937 . By extensive nucleotide sequence and Northern blot analysis , these cDNA clones were found to originate from approximately 42 different genes ( HZF 1 - 42 ) of which only 8 have previously been described . The large number of individual genes represented among the 63 clones and their apparent non - cell - type - specific expression suggest that the majority of the Kruppel - related zinc finger genes are likely to be expressed in most human tissues . In contrast , some of the genes displayed a restricted expression pattern , indicating that they represent potential regulators of monocyte differentiation or proliferation . Detailed structural analysis of the first 12 cDNAs ( HZF 1 - 10 ) and a partial characterization of HZF 11 - 42 revealed that a common feature of human Kruppel - related zinc finger proteins is the presence of tandem arrays of zinc fingers ranging in number from 3 to over 20 that are preferentially located in the carboxy - terminal regions of the proteins . In addition , several novel KRAB - containing zinc finger genes and a novel conserved sequence element were identified . CAG repeat length variation in sperm from a patient with Kennedy ' s disease . Using a modified sperm typing protocol , the mutation frequency of the CAG repeat region at the androgen receptor locus has been measured using a rare semen sample from an individual with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy ( SBMA ) . The average expansion was 2 . 7 repeats . More than half of the expansions involved one or two repeats ; the largest was 11 repeats . 68 % of the contractions were also one or two repeats but six ( 16 % ) were very large ( 12 - 25 repeats ) . One contraction generated an allele in an intermediate size range ( 33 - 39 repeats ) . Such alleles have not been observed among more than 900 normal and SBMA X - chromosomes that have been examined . Comparison of the SBMA sperm typing results with mutation frequency data on normal alleles supports the hypothesis that trinucleotide repeat expansions may have a different molecular origin than contractions . Benzene toxicity towards lymphocytes is thought to be mediated by metabolites of benzene including benzoquinone ( BQ ) . NAD ( P ) H : quinone reductase ( QR ) is known to protect against BQ toxicity . We had previously found that aspirin - like drugs ( ALD ) induce AP - 1 in human T lymphocytes . It was therefore hypothesized that ALD would protect lymphocytes against BQ toxicity by inducing QR . Molt - 4 cells ( M4 ) , a human T lymphocyte cell line , were incubated with different concentrations of two ALD , flurbiprofen and sodium diclofenac , and then exposed to BQ . Toxicity was measured by viability ( trypan blue exclusion ) . The protective effect of ALD was significantly reduced by dicoumarol , a QR - specific inhibitor . Since human T cells and T cell lines do not metabolize arachidonic acid , our data suggest that ALD can protect human T lymphocytes against a metabolite of benzene by induction of QR activity . Correlation of differentiation - inducing activity of retinoids on human leukemia cell lines HL - 60 and NB4 . Retinoids , including all - trans - retinoic acid , its isomers , and fifty synthetic retinoids ( retinobenzoic acids ) , were tested for differentiation - inducing activity on human leukemia cell lines HL - 60 and NB4 . Platelet - activating factor ( PAF ) positively auto - regulates the expression of human PAF receptor transcript 1 ( leukocyte - type ) through NF - kappa B . The human platelet - activating factor receptor ( PAFR ) gene is transcribed by two distinct promoters ( promoter 1 and promoter 2 ) to generate two transcripts ( designated as PAFR transcript 1 and PAFR transcript 2 ) , though their open reading frames are identical . By primer extension analysis to discriminate two transcripts , we found that the levels of PAFR transcript 1 ( leukocyte - type ) , but not PAFR transcript 2 ( tissue - type ) , are upregulated by PAF as well as by 12 - O - tetradecanoylphorbol - 13 - acetate ( TPA ) in the human stomach cancer cell line ( JR - St cells ) which expresses both functional PAFR transcript 1 and PAFR transcript 2 endogenously . Functional analysis of the promoter 1 with a transient expression assay using chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) gene as a reporter showed that both PAF and TPA activated the promoter 1 but not the deleted promoter lacking the three consensus binding sites for NF - kappa B located from - 571 bp to - 459 bp . A cDNA library was prepared from peripheral blood lymphocytes of an autoimmune patient with primary Sjogrens ' syndrome . The cDNA library was screened with the patients own autoimmune serum being monospecific for the nuclear autoantigen La / SS - B . Thereby an alternative type of La mRNA was identified that differed from the known La mRNA due to an exchange of the exon 1 . Sequencing of the genomic region between the exons 1 and 2 showed that the alternative 5 ' - end is a part of the intron . In addition , the presence of an alternative promoter site , which exists within the intron downstream of the exon 1 , became evident . In consequence , the alternative La mRNA is the result of a promoter switching combined with an alternative splicing mechanism . In the intron , further transcription factor binding sites , including a NF - kappa B element , were identified leading to the suggestion that the expression of the gene encoding for the nuclear autoantigen La / SS - B alters in dependence on disease conditions . Cross - linking CD40 on B cells rapidly activates nuclear factor - kappa B . Cross - linking CD40 on B cells can lead to homotypic cell adhesion , IL - 6 production , and , in combination with cytokines , to Ig isotype switching . Tyrosine kinase activity is increased shortly after engagement of this receptor . Little is known about how the very early events induced by CD40 cross - linking link to cellular responses . In this study , we demonstrate that nuclear factor ( NF ) - kappa B and NF - kappa B - like transcription factors are activated after cross - linking CD40 on resting human tonsillar B cells and on B cell lines . The complexes detected in electrophoretic mobility shift assays contain p50 , p65 ( RelA ) , c - Rel , and most likely other components . By using transient transfection assays , we found that cross - linking CD40 supports NF - kappa B - dependent gene expression . Our results define the NF - kappa B system as an intermediate event in CD40 signaling and suggest that the CD40 pathway can influence the expression of B cell - associated genes with NF - kappa B consensus sites . Protease inhibitors block lipopolysaccharide induction of tissue factor gene expression in human monocytic cells by preventing activation of c - Rel / p65 heterodimers . Tissue factor ( TF ) is expressed rapidly by human monocytes exposed to bacterial endotoxin ( lipopolysaccharide , or LPS ) . Transcriptional regulation is mediated by binding of c - Rel / p65 heterodimers to a kappa B - like site in the TF promoter . Nuclear translocation of cytosolic c - Rel / p65 heterodimers and other members of the NF - kappa B / Rel family requires dissociation and proteolytic degradation of the inhibitor protein , I kappa B alpha . The protease inhibitors N alpha - tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone ( TPCK ) and N alpha - tosyl - L - lysine chloromethyl ketone ( TLCK ) block activation of NF - kappa B / Rel proteins by preventing degradation of I kappa B alpha . To determine if TPCK and TLCK inhibited LPS induction of TF expression , freshly isolated human monocytes and monocytic THP - 1 cells were pretreated with these inhibitors for 30 min before LPS stimulation . Both TPCK and TLCK inhibited LPS induction of TF protein , TF mRNA and TF promoter activity in a dose - dependent manner . Taken together , these data indicated that inhibiting nuclear translocation of c - Rel / p65 heterodimers prevented LPS induction of TF gene transcription in monocytic cells . 1 , 25 - Dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptors in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism . A decreased number of calcitriol ( 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 ) receptors has been observed in parathyroid glands of uremic animals . In humans , studies carried out in surgically removed parathyroid glands have shown that calcitriol binding is higher in primary than in secondary hyperparathyroidism . Since specific receptors for calcitriol have been described in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) , we have investigated the specific uptake of 3H - labelled 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 in PBMC of 12 women with primary hyperparathyroidism ( PHP ) , 8 women with hyperparathyroidism secondary to chronic renal failure ( SH ) , 9 women with renal transplant ( RT ) , and 23 healthy women . In three patients with PHP who were subjected to parathyroidectomy , the calcitriol number came down to normal . The severe phenotype of females with tiny ring X chromosomes is associated with inability of these chromosomes to undergo X inactivation . Mental retardation and a constellation of congenital malformations not usually associated with Turner syndrome are seen in some females with a mosaic 45 , X / 46 , X , r ( X ) karyotype . The two tiny ring X chromosomes studied with an antibody specific for the acetylated isoforms of histone H4 marking transcribed chromatin domains were labeled at a level consistent with their being active . We also examined tow of the XISTE - ring chromosomes to determine whether genes that are normally silent on an inactive X are expressed from these chromosomes . Analyses of hybrid cells show that TIMP , ZXDA , and ZXDB loci on the proximal short arm , and AR and PHKA1 loci on the long arm , are well expressed from the tiny ring X chromosome lacking XIST DNA . Studies of the ring chromosome that has XIST DNA but does not transcribe it show that its AR allele is transcribed along with the one on the normal X allele . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) Inhibition of activation of transcription factor AP - 1 by CD28 signalling in human T - cells . Co - stimulation of T - lymphocytes by T - cell receptor ( TcR ) occupancy and activation of the CD28 surface molecule results in enhanced proliferation and interleukin 2 ( IL - 2 ) production . Stimulation of T - cells by agonistic anti - CD28 antibodies in conjunction with phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) - or TcR - derived signals induces the enhanced activation of the transcription factor NF - kappa B . Whereas anti - CD28 together with PMA increased the DNA binding and trans - activation activity of NF - kappa B , PMA - induced activation of AP - 1 was significantly suppressed . The inhibitory effect exerted by anti - CD28 was observed at the level of DNA binding as well as in functional reporter - gene assays . These results suggest that the two transcription factors are independently regulated and may perform different functions during T - cell activation . HIV - 1 Nef leads to inhibition or activation of T cells depending on its intracellular localization . Nef of primate lentiviruses is required for viremia and progression to AIDS in monkeys . Negative , positive , and no effects of Nef have also been reported on viral replication in cells . To reconcile these observations , we expressed a hybrid CD8 - Nef protein in Jurkat cells . Two opposite phenotypes were found , which depended on the intracellular localization of Nef . Expressed in the cytoplasm or on the cell surface , the chimera inhibited or activated early signaling events from the T cell antigen receptor . Activated Jurkat cells died by apoptosis , and only cells with mutated nef genes expressing truncated Nefs survived , which rendered Nef nonfunctional . These mutations paralleled those in other viral strains passaged in vitro . Not only do these positional effects of Nef reconcile diverse phenotypes of Nef and suggest a role for its N - terminal myristylation , but they also explain effects of Nef in HIV infection and progression to AIDS . An intricate arrangement of binding sites for the Ets family of transcription factors regulates activity of the alpha 4 integrin gene promoter . alpha 4 integrins mediate cell - cell and cell - extracellular matrix interactions that are critical for maturation and function of the immune system as well as differentiation of skeletal muscle . Here we examine molecular mechanisms controlling the pattern of alpha 4 expression . Three binding sites for the Ets family of transcription factors are found in this region : two adjacent sites at positions - 50 and - 54 bp and a more 5 ' site at position - 67 bp . Using a series of constructs containing deletions and mutations in this region , we found that the 3 ' - most site alone was sufficient for binding GA - binding protein alpha ( GABP alpha ) / GABP beta and for a low level of transcriptional activation . Deletion of the 5 ' - most Ets site had no effect on binding to GABP alpha / GABP beta , but it eliminated a . Concomitant with this loss of a , a new Ets - 1 - containing complex ` ` c ` ` appeared . Complex c substituted efficiently for complex a in transcriptional activation . We conclude that although neither of the two 5 ' - most Ets sites alone binds nuclear protein , they appear to act as modulators which control the pattern of Ets proteins that bind the alpha 4 gene promoter . Mechanism of antiandrogen action : conformational changes of the receptor . Androgen receptor mRNA was translated in vitro , and androgen - and antiandrogen - bound receptor complexes were studied using limited proteolytic digestion by trypsin . Partial proteolysis of androgen - bound receptor protein resulted in a 29 - kDa proteolysis - resisting fragment , whereas antiandrogen binding stabilised a 35 - kDa fragment . Both fragments contain the entire ligand binding domain , and the 35 - kDa fragment extended into the hinge region of the receptor . Several antiandrogens show agonistic properties for a mutated androgen receptor ( LNCaP cell variant ) ; trypsin digestion of antiandrogen - bound mutated receptor also resulted in a 29 - kDa fragment . Our results point to an important difference between antiandrogens and antagonists of other steroid hormone receptors . Differences in conformation of the hinge region distinguish androgen - bound from antiandrogen - bound receptor complexes , which represents an important feature of antiandrogen action . Activation of nuclear factor kappa B in human neuroblastoma cell lines . The nuclear factor kappa B ( NF - kappa B ) is a eukaryotic transcription factor . In B cells and macrophages it is constitutively present in cell nuclei , whereas in many other cell types , NF - kappa B translocates from cytosol to nucleus as a result of transduction by tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) , phorbol ester , and other polyclonal signals . Using neuroblastoma cell lines as models , we have shown that in neural cells NF - kappa B was present in the cytosol and translocated into nuclei as a result of TNF alpha treatment . The TNF alpha - activated NF - kappa B was transcriptionally functional . NF - kappa B activation by TNF alpha was not correlated with cell differentiation or proliferation . In a NGF - responsive rat pheochromocytoma cell line , PC12 , PMA activated NF - kappa B , whereas NGF did not . In other neuroblastoma cell lines , such as SK - N - Be ( 2 ) , the lack of PMA induction of differentiation was correlated with the lack of NF - kappa B activation . We found , moreover , that in SK - N - Be ( 2 ) cells protein kinase C ( PKC ) enzymatic activity was much lower compared with that in a control cell line and that the low PKC enzymatic activity was due to low PKC protein expression . NF - kappa B was not activated by retinoic acid , which induced morphological differentiation of all the neuroblastoma cell lines used in the present study . Thus , NF - kappa B activation was not required for neuroblastoma cell differentiation . Furthermore , the results obtained with TNF alpha proved that NF - kappa B activation was not sufficient for induction of neuroblastoma differentiation . ERP , a new member of the ets transcription factor / oncoprotein family : cloning , characterization , and differential expression during B - lymphocyte development . The ets gene family encodes a group of proteins which function as transcription factors under physiological conditions and , if aberrantly expressed , can cause cellular transformation . We have recently identified two regulatory elements in the murine immunoglobulin heavy - chain ( IgH ) enhancer , pi and microB , which exhibit striking similarity to binding sites for ets - related proteins . The ERP protein contains a region of high homology with the ETS DNA - binding domain common to all members of the ets transcription factor / oncoprotein family . Three additional smaller regions show homology to the ELK - 1 and SAP - 1 genes , a subgroup of the ets gene family that interacts with the serum response factor . Removal of the carboxy terminus enables ERP to interact with a variety of ets - binding sites including the E74 site , the IgH enhancer pi site , and the lck promoter ets site , suggesting a carboxy - terminal negative regulatory domain . At least three ERP - related transcripts are expressed in a variety of tissues . However , within the B - cell lineage , ERP is highly expressed primarily at early stages of B - lymphocyte development , and expression declines drastically upon B - cell maturation , correlating with the enhancer activity of the IgH pi site . These data suggest that ERP might play a role in B - cell development and in IgH gene regulation . Gene for a tissue - specific transcriptional activator ( EBF or Olf - 1 ) , expressed in early B lymphocytes , adipocytes , and olfactory neurons , is located on human chromosome 5 , band q34 , and proximal mouse chromosome 11 . Murine B lymphocytes , adipocytes , and olfactory neurons contain a DNA - binding protein that participates in the regulation of genes encoding tissue - specific components of signal transduction . Purification and cloning of this protein , termed early B - cell factor ( EBF ) , from murine B lymphocytes and independent cloning of a protein , termed Olf - 1 , from olfactory neuronal cells revealed virtual complete amino acid sequence identity between these proteins . As a first step towards identifying a human genetic disorder or mouse mutation for which EBF could be a candidate gene , we have chromosomally mapped the corresponding locus in both species . By Southern hybridization analyses of somatic cell hybrid panels with murine cDNA probe , fluorescence chromosomal in situ hybridization ( FISH ) of human genomic clones , and analysis of recombinant inbred mouse strains , we have found single sites for EBF homologous sequences on human Chromosome ( Chr ) 5 , band q34 , and on proximal mouse Chr 11 , in an evolutionarily conserved region . Calcineurin activates transcription from the GM - CSF promoter in synergy with either protein kinase C or NF - kappa B / AP - 1 in T cells . The GM - kappa B sequence is recognized by NF - kappa B , which is mainly induced by PMA . The CLE0 sequence interacts with factors , related to a PMA - induced AP - 1 and a PMA / A23187 - induced NF - AT . We examined whether signal transducing components in T cells can activate transcription of the GM - CSF gene . Cotransfection of NF - kappa B ( p50 / p65 ) - or AP - 1 ( c - Jun / c - Fos ) - expression vectors into Jurkat cells with a luciferase reporter containing the GM - CSF promoter did not stimulate transcription from the GM - CSF promoter . In contrast , cotransfection with a combination of NF - kappa B and AP - 1 significantly augmented transcription from the GM - CSF promoter containing the GM - kappa B / GC - box and the CLE0 ( AP - 1 / NF - AT ) . Expression of a constitutively active calcineurin ( CN ) , a Ca2 + / calmodulin - dependent protein phosphatase , potentiated by two fold the transcriptional activation by NF - kappa B / AP - 1 . Both constitutively active forms of CN and protein kinase C ( PKC ) synergistically activated transcription from the GM - CSF promoter . These results suggest that cooperation among NF - kappa B - , AP - 1 - and NF - AT - binding sequences is required for induction of the GM - CSF gene through PKC - and Ca2 + - signaling pathways downstream of T cell activation . Expression of the human PRL ( hPRL ) gene in extrapituitary sites such as the uterus ( decidualized endometrial stroma and myometrium ) and cells of the hematopoietic lineage is directed by an alternative promoter which is located approximately 6 kilobases ( kb ) upstream of the pituitary - specific start site . In order to delineate the tissue - specific mechanisms governing the control of nonpituitary PRL gene expression , we have cloned and sequenced 3 kb 5 ' - flanking DNA of the upstream decidual / lymphoid ( dPRL ) promoter . Based on sequence homology we identified two binding motifs for Pit - 1 and seven half - sites for glucocorticoid receptor / progesterone receptor ( PR ) binding . We focused our studies on the role of Pit - 1 and of PR as potential transcriptional regulators , since the POU domain protein Pit - 1 is essential in the control of pituitary PRL expression , and progesterone induces decidual transformation of the endometrial stroma , a differentiation process during which the decidual PRL gene is activated . We demonstrate in a variety of cell types , including lymphocytes and endometrial stroma , that Pit - 1 is not involved in the regulation of dPRL promoter / reporter gene constructs carrying 3 kb 5 ' - flanking DNA . When we compared the activity of the transfected dPRL promoter in PRL - secreting and nonsecreting lymphoid cells , we found that the 3 kb 5 ' - flanking region of the dPRL promoter did not contain elements restricting expression to only those lymphocytes that produce PRL but allowed expression of fusion reporter genes irrespective of the status of the endogenous PRL gene . This was in sharp contrast to endometrial cells where 3 kb 5 ' - flanking DNA conferred strong transcriptional activation on the dPRL promoter in decidualized endometrial stromal cells actively secreting PRL , but did not allow transcription in undifferentiated non - PRL - secreting endometrial stromal cells . Activation of the dPRL promoter construct in these undifferentiated cells could however be induced by the addition of cAMP , in the absence of progesterone , suggesting that a signal transduced through the cAMP signaling pathway is a primary inducer of decidual PRL gene expression . Signals and nuclear factors that regulate the expression of interleukin - 4 and interleukin - 5 genes in helper T cells . Mouse thymoma line EL - 4 cells produce cytokines such as interleukin ( IL ) - 2 , IL - 3 , IL - 4 , IL - 10 , and granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor in response to phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) . EL - 4 cells also produce low levels of IL - 5 when stimulated by PMA alone ; however , cAMP greatly augments PMA - dependent IL - 5 production . A transient transfection assay revealed that two signals , PMA and cAMP , are required for optimal activation of the IL - 5 promoter . In contrast , cAMP almost completely inhibited the PMA - dependent activation of the endogenous IL - 2 gene , as well as the transfected IL - 2 promoter . These results indicate that the IL - 5 gene is positively regulated by cAMP in a manner opposite to that for the IL - 2 gene . The P sequence of the IL - 4 gene , defined as a responsive element for PMA and calcium ionophore ( A23187 ) , shares sequence similarity with the NF kappa B and the NF - activated T cell binding sites . We attempted to determine whether NF ( P ) , a nuclear factor specific for the P sequence , is related to NF - kappa B and nuclear factor for activated T cell ( NF - AT ) . In electromobility shift assays both NF - kappa B ( P65 or P65 / P50 heterodimer ) and NF - AT bound to the P sequence . However , sequence specificity of NF - AT was more similar to that of NF ( P ) , and only a small amount of P65 was detected in NF ( P ) . These results indicate that a component or components of NF - AT have the potential to reconstitute NF ( P ) , whereas NF - kappa B alone does not account for NF ( P ) in Jurkat crude extract . Taken together , these results suggest that NF - AT - like factors are involved in the regulation of IL - 4 and IL - 5 genes . Solution structure of a POU - specific homeodomain : 3D - NMR studies of human B - cell transcription factor Oct - 2 . The POU DNA - binding motif defines a conserved family of eukaryotic transcription factors involved in regulation of gene expression . This bipartite motif consists of an N - terminal POU - specific domain ( POUs ) , a flexible linker , and a C - terminal POU - specific homeodomain ( POUHD ) . Here we describe the solution structure of a POU - specific homeodomain . An NMR model is obtained from Oct - 2 , a human B - cell specific transcription factor which participates in the regulation of immunoglobulin genes . A fragment of Oct - 2 containing POUHD and an adjoining linker was expressed in Escherichia coli and characterized by three - dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance ( 3D - NMR ) spectroscopy . Complete 1H and 15N resonance assignment of the POUHD moiety is presented . The POUHD solution structure , as calculated by distance geometry and simulated annealing ( DG / SA ) , is similar to that of canonical homeodomains . A salient difference between solution and crystal structures is observed in the C - terminal segment of alpha - helix 3 ( the HTH recognition helix ) , which is not well ordered in solution . Because this segment presumably folds upon specific DNA binding , its flexibility in solution may reduce the intrinsic DNA affinity of POUHD in the absence of POUs . NF - kappa B - dependent and - independent pathways of HIV activation in a chronically infected T cell line . J delta K cells were isolated as a chronically infected survivor cell line , following infection of Jurkat CD4 + T cells with dl - NF , a mutated strain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) containing a deletion of the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) NF - kappa B sites . J delta K cells exhibited very low levels of constitutive HIV production . HIV - 1 expression was activated from J delta K cells by treatment with phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) , sodium butyrate ( NaB ) , or hexamethylene bisacetamide ( HMBA ) , but not tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - alpha ) , confirming the role of NF - kappa B in mediating TNF - alpha induction of HIV transcription . The strong induction of HIV expression by NaB or HMBA in J delta K cells clearly demonstrates the existence of NF - kappa B - independent mechanisms of HIV activation in chronically infected cells . J delta K cells may provide a useful model for characterizing NF - kappa B - independent transcriptional activation of the HIV LTR . We investigated how these stimuli affect mitogen activated protein ( MAP ) kinases . Alone , each stimulus resulted in little or no activation . Similar to its effect on IL - 2 induction , cyclosporin A ( CsA ) inhibited the synergistic activation of JNK , and a competitive inhibitor of Jun phosphorylation by JNK inhibited IL - 2 promoter activation . By contrast , the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 were fully activated by TPA or TCR stimulation and were not affected by Ca2 + , CD28 , or CsA . Hence , integration of signals that lead to T cell activation occurs at the level of JNK activation . Inhibition of rat splenocyte proliferation with methylprednisolone : in vivo effect of liposomal formulation . Rat splenocytes were found to have greater sensitivity to MPL ( EC50 = 7 . 9 nM ) than do human peripheral blood lymphocytes ( EC50 = 28 nM ) . In vivo studies in rats utilized 2 mg / kg IV bolus doses of liposomal MPL compared to drug in solution . Animals were sacrificed at various times post - dosing until 120 h , spleen was excised and , after incubation of lymphocytes with PHA , splenocyte blastogenic responses were assessed by measuring cellular incorporation of 3H - thymidine . The suppressive effect of liposomal MPL in comparison with free drug was significantly prolonged ( > 120 h vs < 18 h ) . A nonlinear relationship was found between suppression of splenocyte proliferation and the concentration of bound glucocorticoid receptors in spleen . Only partial receptor occupancy accompanied complete lymphocyte suppression . The suppression of endogenous corticosterone in plasma for both treatments was similar with values from L - MPL rats returning to baseline after 24 h . These results demonstrate enhanced efficacy of local immunosuppression by targeting spleen with liposomal MPL . Function of NF - kappa B / Rel binding sites in the major histocompatibility complex class II invariant chain promoter is dependent on cell - specific binding of different NF - kappa B / Rel subunits . The promoter of the human major histocompatibility complex class II - associated invariant - chain gene ( Ii ) contains two NF - kappa B / Rel binding sites located at - 109 to - 118 ( Ii kappa B - 1 ) and - 163 to - 172 ( Ii kappa B - 2 ) from the transcription start site . We report here that the differential function of each of these NF - kappa B / Rel sites in several distinct cell types depends on cell - specific binding of NF - kappa B / Rel transcription factors . Ii kappa B - 1 is a positive regulatory element in B - cell lines and in the Ii - expressing T - cell line , H9 , but acts as a negative regulatory element in myelomonocytic and glia cell lines . Electrophoretic mobility supershift assays determine that members of the NF - kappa B / Rel family of transcription factors can bind to this site in vitro and that DNA - binding complexes that contain p50 , p52 , p65 , and cRel correlate with positive regulation whereas the presence of p50 correlates with negative regulation . In vivo occupancy of this site is observed only in the H9 T - cell line . This differential binding of specific NF - kappa B / Rel subunits is likely to mediate the disparate functions of these two NF - kappa B / Rel binding sites . Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) replicative gene expression in tumour cells of AIDS - related non - Hodgkin ' s lymphoma in relation to CD4 cell number and antibody titres to EBV . METHODS : Seventeen out of 22 cases of ARNHL were selected for the presence of EBV [ Epstein - Barr early region ( EBER ) RNA - positive ] . Immunohistochemistry was performed with anti - ZEBRA , anti - EA - restricted , anti - VCA antibodies and in situ hybridization with BHLF1 / NotI oligoprobes on tumour samples . Results were statistically correlated with those of CD4 + cell counts ( 17 out of 17 ) and with anti - EBV antibody titres ( 13 out of 17 ) assessed using standard immunofluorescence method and enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay procedure using recombinant ZEBRA protein and synthetic peptides as antigens . RESULTS : BZLF1 ( ZEBRA ) or early gene products ( EA - R and EA - D / BHLF1 / NotI ) were detected in a small proportion ( < 0 . 01 - 5 % ) of tumour cells in eight of these 17 cases by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization . Demonstration of replicative gene expression did not correlate with either low CD4 + cell counts ( P > 0 . 05 ) or anti - EBV antibody titres ( P > 0 . 05 ) . Anti - ZEBRA activity was not significantly increased in patients affected with ARNHL , the cells of which expressed replicative gene products ( P > 0 . 05 ) . CONCLUSION : The degree of immunodeficiency does not clearly enhance replicative gene expression in tumour cells of ARNHL . EBV serology , including anti - ZEBRA activity , is not a reliable tool for predicting the occurrence of such proliferations . Effects of prostaglandin E2 on Th0 - type human T cell clones : modulation of functions of nuclear proteins involved in cytokine production . The effects of prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) on cytokine production and proliferation of the CD4 + human helper T cell clone SP - B21 were investigated . In contrast , in cells stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) / A23187 , PGE2 enhanced the production of IL - 4 and IL - 5 , and only partially inhibited the production of other cytokines . Therefore , the effects of PGE2 vary depending on the mode of T cell activation , and the IL - 4 and IL - 5 are regulated differently from other cytokines . In a mobility shift assay , only the NF - kappa B ( p50 / p50 ) homodimer was observed in a complex formed with the kappa B sequence in unstimulated SP - B21 cells . When cells were stimulated with anti - CD3 mAb or PMA / A23187 , a complex formation of NF - kappa B ( p50 / p65 ) heterodimer with the kappa B sequence was induced . Interestingly , PGE2 or di - butyryl ( Bt2 ) cAMP abolished the binding of NF - kappa B ( p50 / p65 ) heterodimer to the kappa B sequence in cells stimulated with anti - CD3 mAb but not with PMA / A23187 . Our results suggest that the target of PGE2 action is a component in the signal transduction pathway leading to the activation of protein kinase C . However , the inhibition of the T cell activation signals by PGE2 is selective . PGE2 enhanced the complex formation with NF - AT , AP - 1 and CLE0 sequences when the cells were activated by either anti - CD3 mAb or PMA / A23187 stimulation . Characterization of NF ( P ) , the nuclear factor that interacts with the regulatory P sequence ( 5 ' - CGAAAATTTCC - 3 ' ) of the human interleukin - 4 gene : relationship to NF - kappa B and NF - AT . The P sequence of the human interleukin - 4 ( IL - 4 ) gene , which was defined as a responsive element for phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate and calcium ionophore ( A23187 ) in Jurkat T cells , shares sequence similarity with the NF - kappa B and the NF - AT binding sites . We examined whether NF ( P ) , a nuclear factor specific for the P sequence , is related to NF - kappa B and NF - AT . NF - kappa B ( P65 or P65 / P50 heterodimer ) bound to the P sequence in electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) and activated transcription through the P sequence when expression plasmids were cotransfected with P sequence - driven reporter plasmids in Jurkat T cells . In EMSAs , NF ( P ) binding was inhibited by the unlabeled NF - AT binding site but not by the unlabeled AP1 binding site and purified NF - AT contained an activity that bound to the P sequence . Both mobility shift and sequence specificity of NF - AT were similar to those of NF ( P ) and only a small amount of P65 was detected in NF ( P ) in crude nuclear extracts . These results indicate that the component ( s ) of NF - AT has the potential to reconstitute NF ( P ) whereas NF - kappa B alone can not account for NF ( P ) in crude extracts . Unlike NF - AT , NF ( P ) does not contain AP1 as its DNA binding component . Activation of early growth response 1 gene transcription and pp90rsk during induction of monocytic differentiation . The present work has studied mechanisms responsible for induction of early growth response 1 ( EGR - 1 ) gene expression during monocytic differentiation of U - 937 myeloid leukemia cells . Differentiation of U - 937 cells with 12 - O - tetradecanoylphorbol - 13 - acetate ( TPA ) , an activator of the serine / threonine protein kinase C , was associated with transcriptional activation of EGR - 1 promoter - reporter constructs . The EGR - 1 promoter contains six CC ( A / T ) 6GG ( CArG ) motifs . The two 5 ' - most distal CArG sequences conferred TPA inducibility . In contrast , there was little effect of TPA on EGR - 1 transcription in a TPA - resistant U - 937 cell variant , designated TUR . Treatment of both U - 937 and TUR cells with okadaic acid , an inhibitor of serine / threonine protein phosphatases 1 and 2A , was associated with induction of monocytic differentiation and EGR - 1 transcription through the 5 ' - most CArG element . Since these findings supported the involvement of serine / threonine protein phosphorylation in the regulation of EGR - 1 expression , we studied activation of the 40S ribosomal protein S6 serine / threonine kinases , pp70S6K and pp90rsk . Although both kinases participate in regulating cell growth , there was no detectable activation of pp70S6K during TPA - or okadaic acid - induced monocytic differentiation . Okadaic acid treatment of both cell types was associated with activation of pp90rsk . Antioxidants inhibit monocyte adhesion by suppressing nuclear factor - kappa B mobilization and induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 in endothelial cells stimulated to generate radicals . Cell adhesion to endothelial cells stimulated by tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF ) is due to induction of surface receptors , such as vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( VCAM - 1 ) . The antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) specifically inhibits activation of nuclear factor - kappa B ( NF - kappa B ) . Since kappa B motifs are present in VCAM - 1 and intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 ( ICAM - 1 ) promoters , we used PDTC to study the regulatory mechanisms of VCAM - 1 and ICAM - 1 induction and subsequent monocyte adhesion in TNF - treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) . Gel - shift analysis in HUVECs demonstrated that PDTC prevented NF - kappa B mobilization by TNF , suggesting that only VCAM - 1 induction was controlled by NF - kappa B . Since HUVECs released superoxide anions in response to TNF , and H2O2 induces VCAM - 1 , PDTC may act as a radical scavenger . Although ICAM - 1 induction was unaffected , inhibitors of NADPH oxidase ( apocynin ) or cytochrome P - 450 ( SKF525a ) suppressed VCAM - 1 induction by TNF , revealing that several radical - generating systems are involved in its regulation . PDTC , apocynin , or SKF525a decreased adhesion of monocytic U937 cells to TNF - treated HUVECs ( by 75 % at 100 mumol / L PDTC ) . Inhibition by anti - VCAM - 1 monoclonal antibody 1G11 indicated that U937 adhesion was VCAM - 1 dependent and suppression by antioxidants was due to reduced VCAM - 1 induction . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) Displacement of an E - box - binding repressor by basic helix - loop - helix proteins : implications for B - cell specificity of the immunoglobulin heavy - chain enhancer . The activity of the immunoglobulin heavy - chain ( IgH ) enhancer is restricted to B cells , although it binds both B - cell - restricted and ubiquitous transcription factors . Activation of the enhancer in non - B cells upon overexpression of the basic helix - loop - helix ( bHLH ) protein E2A appears to be mediated not only by the binding of E2A to its cognate E box but also by the resulting displacement of a repressor from that same site . Hence , we propose that a necessary prerequisite of enhancer activity is the B - cell - specific displacement of a ZEB - like repressor by bHLH proteins . Inhibition of NF - kappa B by sodium salicylate and aspirin [ see comments ] The transcription factor nuclear factor - kappa B ( NF - kappa B ) is critical for the inducible expression of multiple cellular and viral genes involved in inflammation and infection including interleukin - 1 ( IL - 1 ) , IL - 6 , and adhesion molecules . The anti - inflammatory drugs sodium salicylate and aspirin inhibited the activation of NF - kappa B , which further explains the mechanism of action of these drugs . This inhibition prevented the degradation of the NF - kappa B inhibitor , I kappa B , and therefore NF - kappa B was retained in the cytosol . Sodium salicylate and aspirin also inhibited NF - kappa B - dependent transcription from the Ig kappa enhancer and the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) long terminal repeat ( LTR ) in transfected T cells . Expression of antisense myb RNA reduced the amount of c - myb mRNA , and the percentage of Hb - synthesizing cells was decreased to 20 % . In the presence of Epo , c - myb mRNA declined and 20 % of K562 cells synthesized Hb regardless of antisense myb RNA expression . It is suggested that constitutive expression of c - myb mRNA is necessary for Hm - induced differentiation , and that a decrease in the amount of c - myb mRNA induced by antisense myb RNA expression suppresses Hm - induced differentiation . The amount of c - myb mRNA in K562 cells was reduced during the differentiation induced by Epo . Expression of GATA - 1 mRNA was almost constant during Hm - induced differentiation , but increased during Epo treatment . It is supposed that the mechanism of Hm - induced differentiation is distinguished from that of Epo - induced differentiation in K562 cells . Prenatal immune challenge alters the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenocortical axis in adult rats . To study putative teratogenic effects of a T cell - mediated immune response versus an endotoxic challenge , 10 - d - pregnant rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of 5 x 10 ( 8 ) human red blood cells ( HRBC ) or gram - negative bacterial endotoxin ( Escherichia coli LPS : 30 micrograms / kg ) . In addition , after novelty stress the HRBC group , but not the LPS group , showed increased ACTH and corticosterone levels . This study demonstrates that a T cell - mediated immune response as well as an endotoxic challenge during pregnancy can induce anomalies in HPA axis function in adulthood . Clinically , it may be postulated that disturbed fetal brain development due to prenatal immune challenge increases the vulnerability to develop mental illness involving inadequate responses to stress . A low NM23 . H1 gene expression identifying high malignancy human melanomas . The NM23 gene has been proposed as a metastasis - suppressor gene , and its use has been suggested as prognostic factor . In a human malignant melanoma study NM23 expression was found to be significantly lower in metastases that developed less than 24 months after diagnosis of the primary tumours . The present paper studies the expression of the NM23 . H1 gene in cell lines which derive from primary or metastatic human malignant melanomas in relation to staging , infiltration degree , lymphocytic infiltration , cell morphology , cell pigmentation , karyotype , and disease - free survival . The level of mRNA expression of the NM23 gene is significantly lower in cell lines that derive from more infiltrating primary melanomas than in cell lines obtained from less infiltrating tumours . Moreover , cell lines derived from tumours of patients with a disease - free survival of more than 24 months ( 24 - 58 months ) express the NM23 gene at higher levels than cell lines obtained from melanomas of patients with a disease - free survival of less than 24 months ( 6 - 15 months ) . Activation of a novel serine / threonine kinase that phosphorylates c - Fos upon stimulation of T and B lymphocytes via antigen and cytokine receptors . Ligation of Ag receptors in T and B lymphocytes initiates signal transduction cascades which alter the expression of genes that regulate cellular proliferation and differentiation . We have identified and characterized a novel serine / threonine kinase that phosphorylated the proto - oncogene product , c - Fos , and is termed Fos kinase . Fos kinase was rapidly activated after ligation of the CD3 and CD2 receptors in Jurkat and normal human T lymphocytes and in response to IL - 6 and anti - IgM in the human B cell lines AF10 and Ramos , respectively . The phorbol ester , PMA , was also a potent inducer of Fos kinase activity in all of the above populations , suggesting that PKC plays a role in the regulation of this enzyme . Fos kinase phosphorylates c - Fos at a site near the C - terminus , as well as a peptide derived from this region ( residues 359 - 370 , RKGSSSNEPSSD ) , and Fos peptide competitively inhibited c - Fos phosphorylation . Fos kinase was shown to be distinct from other identified serine / threonine kinases , including protein kinase A , protein kinase C , casein kinase II , MAP kinases , p70S6K and p90RSK . Fos kinase was purified by anion exchange chromatography and exhibited an apparent M ( r ) = 65 , 000 and isoelectric point = 6 . 1 . Moreover , its rapid activation suggests it may have a wider role within signal transduction cascades in lymphocytes . Antigenic specificities of human CD4 + T - cell clones recovered from recurrent genital herpes simplex virus type 2 lesions . Lesions resulting from recurrent genital herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) infection are characterized by infiltration of CD4 + lymphocytes . We have investigated the antigenic specificity of 47 HSV - specific CD4 + T - cell clones recovered from the HSV - 2 buttock and thigh lesions of five patients . Clones with proliferative responses to recombinant truncated glycoprotein B ( gB ) or gD of HSV - 2 or purified natural gC of HSV - 2 comprised a minority of the total number of HSV - specific clones isolated from lesions . The gC2 - and gD2 - specific CD4 + clones had cytotoxic activity . The approximate locations of the HSV - 2 genes encoding HSV - 2 type - specific CD4 + antigens have been determined by using HSV - 1 x HSV - 2 intertypic recombinant virus and include the approximate map regions 0 . 30 to 0 . 46 , 0 . 59 to 0 . 67 , 0 . 67 to 0 . 73 , and 0 . 82 to 1 . 0 units . The antigenic specificity of an HLA DQ2 - restricted , HSV - 2 type - specific T - cell clone was mapped to amino acids 425 to 444 of VP16 of HSV - 2 by sequential use of an intertypic recombinant virus containing VP16 of HSV - 2 in an HSV - 1 background , recombinant VP16 fusion proteins , and synthetic peptides . The antigenic specificities of lesion - derived CD4 + T - cell clones are quite diverse and include at least 10 epitopes . Marked basophilia in acute promyelocytic leukaemia treated with all - trans retinoic acid : molecular analysis of the cell origin of the basophils . We report a patient with acute promyelocytic leukaemia who developed marked basophilia during all - trans retinoic acid treatment . These findings suggest that the basophils which appeared during the ATRA treatment are reactive in nature rather than a leukaemic clone . The host response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis includes granuloma formation at sites of infection and systemic symptoms . Cytokines have been identified by immunohistochemistry in granulomas in animal models of bacillus Calmette - Guerin ( BCG ) infection and are released by mononuclear phagocytes upon stimulation by mycobacterial proteins . We have demonstrated that lipoarabinomannan ( LAM ) from the mycobacterial cell wall , which was virtually devoid of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , stimulated mononuclear phagocytes to release IL - 6 in a dose - response manner . Both LAM - and LPS - inducible IL - 6 promoter activity was localized to a DNA fragment , positions - 158 to - 49 , by deletion analysis and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay . Site - directed mutagenesis of one or more of these motifs within the IL - 6 promoter demonstrated that each has positive regulatory activity and that they could act in a function - and orientation - independent manner . Deletion of all three elements abolished inducibility of IL - 6 promoter activity by both LAM and LPS . Regulation of CD14 expression during monocytic differentiation induced with 1 alpha , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 . CD14 , a monocyte / macrophage receptor for the complex of LPS and LPS binding protein , is a differentiation marker for the monocyte / macrophage lineage . We have analyzed the regulation of CD14 expression during 1 alpha , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( VitD3 ) - induced monocytic differentiation . We have recently cloned the CD14 5 ' upstream sequence and demonstrated its tissue - specific promoter activity . Using stable transfection of the monocytoid U937 cell line with a series of deletion mutants of the CD14 5 ' upstream sequence coupled to a reporter gene construct , we show that bp - 128 to - 70 is the critical region for the induction of CD14 expression . A 3 - bp mutation at the distal Sp1 - binding site not only eliminates Sp1 interaction , but also abolishes most of the VitD3 induction of CD14 expression . Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis does not detect a direct interaction of the CD14 distal Sp1 - binding site with the vitamin D3 receptor and its partner , the retinoid X receptor . These data demonstrate that VitD3 induces CD14 indirectly through some intermediary factor , and suggest a critical role for Sp1 in this process . DNA - binding and transcriptional regulatory properties of hepatic leukemia factor ( HLF ) and the t ( 17 ; 19 ) acute lymphoblastic leukemia chimera E2A - HLF . The t ( 17 ; 19 ) translocation in acute lymphoblastic leukemias results in creation of E2A - hepatic leukemia factor ( HLF ) chimeric proteins that contain the DNA - binding and protein dimerization domains of the basic leucine zipper ( bZIP ) protein HLF fused to a portion of E2A proteins with transcriptional activation properties . An in vitro binding site selection procedure was used to determine DNA sequences preferentially bound by wild - type HLF and chimeric E2A - HLF proteins isolated from various t ( 17 ; 19 ) - bearing leukemias . All were found to selectively bind the consensus sequence 5 ' - GTTACGTAAT - 3 ' with high affinity . Wild - type and chimeric HLF proteins also bound closely related sites identified previously for bZIP proteins of both the proline - and acidic amino acid - rich ( PAR ) and C / EBP subfamilies ; however , E2A - HLF proteins were significantly less tolerant of certain deviations from the HLF consensus binding site . These differences were directly attributable to loss of an HLF ancillary DNA - binding domain in all E2A - HLF chimeras and were further exacerbated by a zipper mutation in one isolate . Both wild - type and chimeric HLF proteins displayed transcriptional activator properties in lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells on reporter genes containing HLF or C / EBP consensus binding sites . But on reporter genes with nonoptimal binding sites , their transcriptional properties diverged and E2A - HLF competitively inhibited activation by wild - type PAR proteins . These findings establish a spectrum of binding site - specific transcriptional properties for E2A - HLF which may preferentially activate expression of select subordinate genes as a homodimer and potentially antagonize expression of others through heteromeric interactions . ZAP - 70 tyrosine kinase , CD45 , and T cell receptor involvement in UV - and H2O2 - induced T cell signal transduction . Several mammalian responses to UV irradiation , including the activation of NF - kappa B , are believed to involve tyrosine phosphorylation . We have examined the role of cell surface molecules in these responses . Normal T lymphocytes whose surface expression of CD3 was depleted showed impaired UV - induced tyrosine phosphorylation and Ca2 + signals . However , all these cell types still gave strong Ca2 + and tyrosine phosphorylation responses to H2O2 . The T cell tyrosine kinase ZAP - 70 was found to be highly responsive to UV and H2O2 treatment . ZAP - 70 responsiveness to UV required expression of both CD3 and CD45 , whereas only CD3 was required for the response to H2O2 . UV - induced activation of NF - kappa B was blocked by CD3 depletion , indicating the importance of such cell surface molecules in biological responses to UV . In nonlymphoid cells , the epidermal growth factor receptor displayed increased tyrosine phosphorylation within seconds of UV irradiation . These results suggest that UV - induced signal transduction is mediated via cell surface receptors that normally respond to biological stimulation , whereas H2O2 is able to partially bypass this requirement . We have investigated the effect of redox changes in vivo on the differentiation of two human myeloid cell lines , HL - 60 and KG - 1 . Moreover , DEM abolished phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate - induced activation of the transcription factors AP - 1 and Egr - 1 , suggesting that inhibition of differentiation may be due , at least in part , to redox modifications of these proteins . Lipopolysaccharide induction of tissue factor gene expression in monocytic cells is mediated by binding of c - Rel / p65 heterodimers to a kappa B - like site . Exposure of monocytic cells to bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) activates the NF - kappa B / Rel family of proteins and leads to the rapid induction of inflammatory gene products , including tissue factor ( TF ) . TF is the primary cellular initiator of the coagulation protease cascades . Here we report the characterization of a nuclear complex from human monocytic cells that bound to a kappa B - like site , 5 ' - CGGAGTTTCC - 3 ' , in the 5 ' - flanking region of the human TF gene . In vitro binding studies demonstrated that the TF site bound translated c - Rel and p65 homodimers but not p50 / p65 heterodimers or p50 homodimers . Base - pair substitutions in the TF site indicated that the presence of a cytosine at position 1 precluded binding of NF - kappa B . In fact , under low - ionic - strength conditions , the TF complex did not migrate with translated p50 / p65 dimers but instead comigrated with c - Rel / p65 dimers . Antibodies against the NF - kappa B and Rel proteins and UV cross - linking studies revealed the presence of c - Rel and p65 and the absence of p50 in the TF complex and further showed that c - Rel / p65 heterodimers selectively bound to the TF kappa B - like site . Functional studies indicated that the TF site conferred LPS inducibility on a heterologous promoter and was transactivated by c - Rel or p65 . Taken together , our results demonstrated that binding of c - Rel / p65 heterodimers to a novel kappa B - like site mediated LPS induction of TF gene expression in monocytic cells . Inhibition of T cell activation by the extracellular matrix protein tenascin . Tenascin ( TN ) is an extracellular matrix protein that is expressed widely in the fetus and sparingly in the adult , but reappears at high levels in certain areas of tissue insult such as tumor matrices and sites of wound healing . We show here that soluble TN inhibits proliferation of human T cells in response to alpha CD3 Ab co - immobilized with the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin ( FN ) . TN also inhibits proliferation driven by alpha CD3 / IL - 2 or by phorbol ester / IL - 2 , and it prevents high level induction of IL - 2R . The presence of TN in culture medium does not detectably alter the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation resulting from T cell triggering with alpha CD3 , but at later time points prevents the appearance of functional NF - AT1 transcription factor complexes in T cell nuclear extracts . These findings are consistent with the postulated role for TN as a natural antagonist to FN action , and suggest that T cell responses occurring at tissue sites in which TN is expressed could be influenced by its presence . Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) negative factor ( Nef ) has been shown to down - regulate the transcription factors NF - kappa B and AP - 1 in vitro . On the other hand , stimulation of T cells by mitogens or antibodies to the T - cell receptor ( TCR ) - CD3 complex resulted in the down - regulation of transcriptional factors NF - kappa B and AP - 1 in cells expressing the nef gene compared with cells not expressing the nef gene . Because the Nef protein does not affect the surface expression of the CD3 - TCR complex , we conclude that the Nef protein down - regulates the transcriptional factors NF - kappa B and AP - 1 in T cells in vitro through an effect on the TCR - dependent signal transduction pathway . Effects of alpha - lipoic acid and dihydrolipoic acid on expression of proto - oncogene c - fos . The transcription factor AP - 1 is an important human mediator of the cellular response to serum , growth factors , and phorbol esters such as 12 - O - tetradecanoyl - phorbol - 13 acetate ( TPA ) . The AP - 1 complex consists of distinct protein heterodimers encoded by the proto - oncogene c - fos and c - jun mRNA whose gene expression can be induced by TPA , cyclic AMP and growth factors . Recent findings suggest an involvement of reactive oxygen species in the pathway of TPA and protein kinase C leading to expression of c - fos and c - jun mRNA . To investigate the role of reactive oxygen species we studied the effects of alpha - lipoic acid and dihydrolipoic acid ( natural thiol antioxidants ) on the expression of c - fos mRNA in human Jurkat T cells . These studies support the idea that superoxide anion radical plays a role in the expression of c - fos mRNA . Appraisal of potential therapeutic index of antioxidants on the basis of their in vitro effects on HIV replication in monocytes and interleukin 2 - induced lymphocyte proliferation . Antioxidant molecules have been suggested to be of therapeutic value in the treatment of HIV - infected patients . To evaluate this possibility , we examined in vitro the effects of two types of antioxidant molecules in terms of inhibition of HIV replication in monocytes , one of the main reservoirs of HIV , and also in terms of modulation of the immune competence as measured by PBMC proliferation . We tested the effects of BHA , a phenolic , lipid - soluble , chain - breaking antioxidant , and NAC , a known glutathione precursor with some direct free - radical scavenging properties as well , on the regulation of HIV - 1 expression in latently infected U1 cells and in productively and chronically infected U937 cells . Both antioxidants inhibited TNF - or PMA - induced NF - kappa B activity in U1 cells , as well as the sustained NF - kappa B activity permanently induced by the virus itself in chronically HIV - infected U937 cells . This may be the first limitation to potential antiviral effects of antioxidant therapies . These data warrant prudence in the design of antioxidant - based therapies aimed at suppressing HIV replication . Isolation and characterization of gelatinase granules from human neutrophils . We recently confirmed the existence of gelatinase granules as a subpopulation of peroxidase - negative granules by double - labeling immunogold electron microscopy on intact cells and by subcellular fractionation . Further characterization of gelatinase granules has been hampered by poor separation of specific and gelatinase granules on both two - layer Percoll gradients and sucrose gradients . We found that gelatinase granules , defined as peroxidase - negative granules containing gelatinase but lacking lactoferrin , contain 50 % of total cell gelatinase , with the remaining residing in specific granules . Although no qualitative difference was observed between specific granules and gelatinase granules with respect to cytochrome b558 and Mac - 1 , stimulation of the neutrophil with FMLP resulted in a selective mobilization of the least dense peroxidase - negative granules , ie , gelatinase granules , which , in concert with secretory vesicles , furnish the plasma membrane with Mac - 1 and cytochrome b558 . Regulation of interleukin - 2 receptor alpha chain expression and nuclear factor . kappa B activation by protein kinase C in T lymphocytes . Autocrine role of tumor necrosis factor alpha . The regulation of interleukin - 2 receptor alpha chain ( IL - 2R alpha ) expression and nuclear factor ( NF ) activation by protein kinase C ( PKC ) in resting T cells , has been studied . This activation was due to the translocation of p65 and c - Rel NF . kappa B proteins from cytoplasmic stores to the nucleus , where they bound the kappa B sequence of the IL - 2R alpha promoter either as p50 . p65 or as p50 . c - Rel heterodimers . Interestingly , all of those events were largely indirect and mediated by endogenously secreted tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) , as they were strongly inhibited by a neutralizing anti - TNF alpha monoclonal antibody . Furthermore , cyclosporin A , which blocked TNF alpha production induced by PKC , strongly inhibited IL - 2R alpha and NF . kappa B activation . The addition of either TNF alpha or IL - 2 partially recovered cyclosporin A - induced IL - 2R alpha inhibition , but only TNF alpha completely recovered NF . kappa B activation . Those results indicate that , in resting T cells , PKC activation has only a triggering role , whereas the endogenously secreted TNF alpha plays an essential role in the quantitative control of the expression of IL - 2R alpha chain or NF . kappa B activation . Superantigens activate HIV - 1 gene expression in monocytic cells . Binding of superantigens to MHC class II molecules results in transduction of biochemical signals leading to cellular activation and gene expression . We demonstrate that the staphylococcal superantigens toxic shock syndrome toxin - 1 ( TSST - 1 ) and staphylococcal enterotoxin A ( SEA ) activate HIV - 1 - LTR - driven transcription of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase in the human monocytic cell line THP - 1 . Induction of HIV - 1 - LTR - driven transcription in THP - 1 cells by superantigens was associated with the induction of nuclear factor - kappa B DNA - binding activity . Superantigens also increased viral protein secretion from the granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor - pretreated chronically infected human monocytic cell line U1 . Induction of HIV - 1 gene expression in monocytic cells by superantigens occurred via tumor necrosis factor - alpha - dependent and - independent mechanisms . Our results suggest that superantigens and other MHC class II ligands may activate HIV - 1 gene expression in monocytes / macrophages . Mitogen activation of human peripheral T lymphocytes induces the formation of new cyclic AMP response element - binding protein nuclear complexes . A large body of evidence indicates that experimental agents which raise cellular cAMP levels inhibit T cell growth and division . By contrast , many studies have reported that mitogen activation of T cells increases cAMP levels , implying a positive physiological role for cAMP in the activation process . In the present study we demonstrate that mitogen activation of human peripheral T lymphocytes induces nuclear factors that form complexes with cyclic AMP response element - binding protein ( CREB ) . Four complexes are identified by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay , two of which are induced by mitogen activation . All four complexes contain CREB and are bound to the cAMP response element ( CRE ) core sequence ( TGACGTCA ) , as indicated by antibody and oligonucleotide competition experiments . Binding of the four complexes to CRE is prevented by dephosphorylation of nuclear extracts and is restored by rephosphorylation with cAMP - dependent protein kinase or endogenous kinases . Similar complexes are detected in nuclear extracts of Jurkat cells . Mitogen induction of the electrophoretic mobility shift assay complexes is not accounted for by protein phosphorylation or by induction of CREB . Induction of new CREB complexes implies a physiological role for cAMP in mitogen activation of T lymphocytes . Alpha - tocopherol inhibits agonist - induced monocytic cell adhesion to cultured human endothelial cells . Antioxidants have been proposed to be anti - atherosclerotic agents ; however , the mechanisms underlying their beneficial effects are poorly understood . Human umbilical vein ECs were pretreated with alpha - tcp before stimulation with known agonists of monocyte adhesion : IL - 1 ( 10 ng / ml ) , LPS ( 10 ng / ml ) , thrombin ( 30 U / ml ) , or PMA ( 10 nM ) . The IC50 of alpha - tcp on an IL - 1 - induced response was 45 microM . The inhibition correlated with a decrease in steady state levels of E - selectin mRNA and cell surface expression of E - selectin which is consistent with the ability of a monoclonal antibody to E - selectin to inhibit monocytic cell adhesion in this system . Probucol ( 50 microM ) and N - acetylcysteine ( 20 mM ) also inhibited agonist - induced monocytic cell adhesion ; whereas , several other antioxidants had no significant effect . Protein kinase C ( PKC ) does not appear to play a role in the alpha - tcp effect since no suppression of phosphorylation of PKC substrates was observed . Activation of the transcription factor NF - kappa B is reported to be necessary but not sufficient for E - selectin expression in EC . Electrophoretic mobility shift assays failed to show an alpha - tcp - induced decrease in activation of this transcription factor after cytokine stimulation . It has been hypothesized that alpha - tcp acts as an anti - atherosclerotic molecule by inhibiting generation of oxidized LDL - - a putative triggering molecule in the atherosclerotic process . Our results point to a novel alternative mechanism of action of alpha - tcp . The Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) is a potent activator of long terminal repeat - directed transcription . While in most cell types , activation requires interaction of Tat with the unusual transcription element TAR , astrocytic glial cells support TAR - independent transactivation of HIV - 1 transcription by Tat . This alternative pathway of Tat activation is mediated by the viral enhancer , a kappa B domain capable of binding the prototypical form of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B ( NF - kappa B ) present in many cell types , including T lymphocytes . The present study demonstrates the existence of kappa B - specific binding factors present in human glial astrocytes that differ from prototypical NF - kappa B . The novel astrocyte - derived kappa B - binding activity is retained on an HIV - 1 Tat affinity column , while prototypical NF - kappa B from Jurkat T cells is not . In vitro transcription studies demonstrate that astrocyte - derived kappa B - binding factors activate transcription of the HIV - 1 long terminal repeat and that this activation is dependent on the kappa B domain . Moreover , TAR - independent transactivation of HIV - 1 transcription is reproduced in vitro in an astrocyte factor - dependent manner which correlates with kappa B - binding activity . The importance of the central nervous system - enriched kappa B transcription factor in the regulation of HIV - 1 expression is discussed . Human interleukin - 13 activates the interleukin - 4 - dependent transcription factor NF - IL4 sharing a DNA binding motif with an interferon - gamma - induced nuclear binding factor . The effects of interleukin - 13 ( IL - 13 ) and interleukin - 4 ( IL - 4 ) on cellular functions were shown to be quite similar . We provide evidence that in monocytes as well as in T lymphocytes both IL - 4 and IL - 13 activate the same recently identified transcription factor NF - IL4 which binds to the specific responsive element IL - 4RE . In addition , we show that a nuclear factor activated by interferon - gamma also interacts with the IL - 4RE . It differs from NF - IL4 in the electrophoretic mobility of the complex with DNA , in its DNA - binding specificity and in the proteins interacting with the DNA sequence . Sensitivity against various enzyme inhibitors suggests that components of the signal transduction pathway are shared by all three cytokines . Encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosomal entry site RNA - protein interactions . Translational initiation of encephalomyocarditis virus ( EMCV ) mRNA occurs by ribosomal entry into the 5 ' nontranslated region of the EMCV mRNA , rather than by ribosomal scanning . Internal ribosomal binding requires a cis - acting element termed the internal ribosomal entry site ( IRES ) . IRES elements have been proposed to be involved in the translation of picornavirus mRNAs and some cellular mRNAs . Internal ribosome binding likely requires the interaction of trans - acting factors that recognize both the mRNA and the ribosomal complex . Five cellular proteins ( p52 , p57 , p70 , p72 , and p100 ) cross - link the EMCV IRES or fragments of the IRES . Recently , p57 was identified to be very similar , if not identical , to polypyrimidine tract - binding protein . On the basis of cross - linking results with 21 different EMCV IRES fragments and cytoplasmic HeLa extract or rabbit reticulocyte lysate as the source of polypeptides , consensus binding sites for p52 , p57 , p70 , and p100 are proposed . It is suggested that each of these proteins recognizes primarily a structural feature of the RNA rather than a specific sequence . A novel heterodimerization partner for thyroid hormone receptor . Peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor . In this study we have identified the peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor ( PPAR ) as a new thyroid hormone receptor ( THR ) auxiliary nuclear protein , heterodimerizing with THR in solution . Although these heterodimers do not recognize a classical thyroid hormone response element ( TRE ) characterized by direct repeat separated by four nucleotides ( DR + 4 ) , PPAR behaves as a dominant negative regulator of thyroid hormone ( TH ) action . However , a TH - dependent positive effect is elicited by selective interaction of the THR beta - PPAR but not the THR alpha - PPAR heterodimer with a novel TRE ( DR + 2 ) . The critical region of THR beta was mapped to 3 amino acids in the distal box of the DNA binding domain . In addition to PMA , cells of the THP - 1 myeloid leukemia cell line acquire macrophage - like characteristics after treatment with all - trans retinoic acid ( RA ) . To analyze the signal transduction mechanisms induced by RA , we first compared the effects of PMA and RA on the expression of genes which are known to be regulated during monocytic differentiation . Both RA and PMA effectively down - regulated c - myc expression , while c - myb expression decreased only after PMA treatment . Expression of the beta 2 - integrin genes , CD11a and CD11b , was clearly increased after both of these treatments . Their effects on the src - family tyrosine kinase genes were different : hck expression was similarly induced by these agents but lyn expression was stronger and more rapid after RA treatment . RA also enhanced lyn mRNA production rapidly in HL - 60 , indicating that the activation of lyn gene expression is common in monocytic and granulocytic maturation of myeloid leukemia cells . To examine whether the AP - 1 enhancer activity is involved in RA - induced monocytic differentiation , THP - 1 cells were transiently transfected with a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) - reporter gene containing 5 copies of the AP - 1 binding sites . In contrast to PMA , RA did not induce any CAT activity in these cells , thus suggesting that the RA - induced changes in the expression of those genes described above were not dependent on the AP - 1 enhancer activity . An active v - abl protein tyrosine kinase blocks immunoglobulin light - chain gene rearrangement . Most of these cells have rearranged their heavy - chain locus but not their light chain genes , suggesting that an active v - abl protein interferes with this differentiation step . These events are accompanied by marked increases in the expression of RAG - 1 and RAG - 2 RNAs . These increases occur in the absence of protein synthesis but are dependent on inactivation of the v - abl protein tyrosine kinase . As documented in the accompanying paper ( Klug et al . , this issue ) , an active v - abl protein also suppresses the activity of NF - kappa B / rel and expression controlled by the kappa intron enhancer . Together these data demonstrate that the v - abl protein specifically interferes with light - chain gene rearrangement by suppressing at least two pathways essential for this stage of B - cell differentiation and suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation is important in regulating RAG gene expression . Calcium signalling in T cells stimulated by a cyclophilin B - binding protein . The immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A blocks a calcium - dependent signal from the T - cell receptor ( TCR ) that normally leads to T - cell activation . When bound to cyclophilin , cyclosporin A binds and inactivates the key signalling intermediate calcineurin . To identify potential cellular homologues of cyclosporin A that might regulate calcium signalling , we have cloned human genes encoding cyclophilin B - binding - proteins using the yeast two - hybrid system . One gene product , when overexpressed in Jurkat T cells , specifically induced transcription from the interleukin - 2 enhancer , by activating the T - cell - specific transcription factors NF - AT and NF - IL2A . This protein , termed calcium - signal modulating cyclophilin ligand ( CAML ) , acts downstream of the TCR and upstream of calcineurin by causing an influx of calcium . CAML appears to be a new participant in the calcium - signal transduction pathway , implicating cyclophilin B in calcium signalling , even in the absence of cyclosporin . Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from seventeen patients with primary myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS ) in advanced stage were enriched for blasts and tested for ( 1 ) karyotype , ( 2 ) genomic configuration and ( 3 ) expression of IL - 3 , GM - CSF , FMS and EGR - 1 genes which are all located on the long arm of chromosome 5 . Aims of the study were to ( 1 ) assess the potential role of the expression of these genes in the maintenance and expansion of the neoplastic clones and ( 2 ) search for constitutional losses or rearrangements of one allele followed by a deletion of the second allele of the same genes in the leukemic cells . The latter issue was investigated by comparing , in 8 cases , constitutive DNA from skin fibroblasts with leukemic DNA . Eleven of the 17 patients had abnormal karyotypes . The M - CSF gene was expressed in 6 cases and the FMS and the EGR - 1 genes were expressed in 2 of the latter cases . An autocrine mechanism of growth could be hypothesized only for the 2 patients whose cells expressed both the M - CSF and FMS genes . No germline changes or rearrangements were observed in any of the genes studied . Thus , deregulation of genes encoding for certain hemopoietic growth factors or receptors does not seem to represent a major mechanism of MDS progression . A novel human homeobox gene distantly related to proboscipedia is expressed in lymphoid and pancreatic tissues . A novel human homeobox gene , HB9 , was isolated from a cDNA library prepared from in vitro stimulated human tonsil B lymphocytes and from a human genomic library . The HB9 gene is composed of 3 exons spread over 6 kilobases of DNA . An open reading frame of 1206 nucleotides is in frame with a diverged homeodomain . The predicted HB9 protein has a molecular mass of 41 kilodaltons and is enriched for alanine , glycine , and leucine . The HB9 homeodomain is most similar to that of the Drosophila melanogaster homeobox gene proboscipedia . Northern blot analysis of poly ( A ) RNA purified from the human B cell line RPMI 8226 and from activated T cells revealed a major mRNA transcript of 2 . 2 kilobases . Reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction was used to examine HB9 RNA transcripts in hematopoietic cell lines . HB9 RNA transcripts were most prevalent in several human B cell lines and K562 cells . In addition , transcripts were detected in RNA prepared from tonsil B cells and in situ hybridization studies localized them in the germinal center region of adult tonsil . These findings suggest the involvement of HB9 in regulating gene transcription in lymphoid and pancreatic tissues . Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat upregulates interleukin - 2 secretion in activated T cells . Dysregulation of cytokines secreted by T cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AIDS . To investigate the effects of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) Tat on interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) expression , we used IL - 2 promoter - chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs and IL - 2 - secreting Jurkat T cells as a model system . Transient expression of HIV - 1 Tat induced a five - to eightfold increase in IL - 2 promoter activity in Jurkat T cells stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and phorbol myristate acetate . IL - 2 secretion was increased more than twofold in both Jurkat T cells and primary T cells stimulated by extracellular HIV - 1 Tat protein . Analysis of mRNA suggested that Tat exerts its effect on IL - 2 primarily at the transcriptional level . The NF - kappa B site at positions - 206 to - 195 of the IL - 2 promoter was required but not sufficient for the Tat effect . The Tat - mediated increase in IL - 2 promoter activity could selectively be blocked by antisense tat or - unlike the analogous effect of human T - cell lymphotropic virus type 1 Tax - by cyclosporin A . Furthermore , it might contribute to the hypergammaglobulinem or , together with other cytokines found to be dysregulated , the T - helper cell dysfunctions observed in AIDS patients . Activation of nuclear factor kappa B in human lymphoblastoid cells by low - dose ionizing radiation . Nuclear factor kappa B ( NF - kappa B ) is a pleiotropic transcription factor which is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several specific genes . These results are in a dose range where the viability of the cells remains very high . After exposure to 137Cs gamma rays at a dose rate of 1 . 17 Gy / min , a maximum in expression of NF - kappa B was seen at 8 h after a 0 . 5 - Gy exposure . Time - course studies revealed a biphasic time - dependent expression after 0 . 5 - , 1 - and 2 - Gy exposures . However , for each time examined , the expression of NF - kappa B was maximum after the 0 . 5 - Gy exposure . Alternative splicing of RNA transcripts encoded by the murine p105 NF - kappa B gene generates I kappa B gamma isoforms with different inhibitory activities . The gene encoding the 105 - kDa protein ( p105 ) precursor of the p50 subunit of transcription factor NF - kappa B also encodes a p70 I kappa B protein , I kappa B gamma , which is identical to the C - terminal 607 amino acids of p105 . Here we show that alternative RNA splicing generates I kappa B gamma isoforms with properties different from those of p70 . One 63 - kDa isoform , termed I kappa B gamma - 1 , which lacks 59 amino acids C - terminal to ankyrin repeat 7 , has a novel 35 - amino acid C terminus encoded by an alternative reading frame of the p105 gene . A 55 - kDa isoform , I kappa B gamma - 2 , lacks the 190 C - terminal amino acids of p70 I kappa B gamma . In contrast to p70 I kappa B gamma , which is a cytoplasmic protein , I kappa B gamma - 1 is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus , whereas I kappa B gamma - 2 is predominantly nuclear . The I kappa B gamma isoforms also display differences in specificity and affinity for Rel / NF - kappa B proteins . While p70 I kappa B gamma inhibits p50 - , p65 - , and c - Rel - mediated transactivation and / or DNA binding , both I kappa B gamma - 1 and I kappa B gamma - 2 are specific for p50 and have different affinities for this subunit . The absence in I kappa B gamma - 1 and I kappa B gamma - 2 of a protein kinase A site whose phosphorylation modulates p70 I kappa B gamma inhibitory activity suggests that alternative RNA splicing may be used to generate I kappa B gamma isoforms that respond differently to intracellular signals . Structure and expression of the human GATA3 gene . GATA3 , a member of the GATA family that is abundantly expressed in the T - lymphocyte lineage , is thought to participate in T - cell receptor gene activation through binding to enhancers . To understand GATA3 gene regulation , we cloned the human gene and the 5 ' end of the mouse GATA3 gene . We show that the human GATA3 gene contains six exons distributed over 17 kb of DNA . The promoter sequence analysis of these two genes revealed that they are embedded within a CpG island and share structural features often found in the promoters of housekeeping genes . Finally , we show that a DNA fragment containing the human GATA3 transcription unit , 3 kb upstream from the initiation site and 4 kb downstream from the polyadenylation site , displays T - cell specificity . Characterization of the human gene encoding LBR , an integral protein of the nuclear envelope inner membrane . We have characterized the human gene encoding LBR , an integral protein of the nuclear envelope inner membrane . Restriction mapping shows that the transcription unit spans approximately 35 kilobases . A transcription start site is located approximately 4 kilobases 5 ' to the translation initiation codon , and an RNA splice of 3863 bases occurs in the 5 ' - untranslated region to generate mature HeLa cell mRNA . 5 ' to the identified transcription start site are two CCAAT sequences and potential recognition sites for several transcription factors including Sp1 , AP - 1 , AP - 2 , and NF - kB . There are 13 protein coding exons in the LBR gene . LBR ' s nucleoplasmic domain is encoded by exons 1 - 4 , and its hydrophobic domain , with eight putative transmembrane segments , is encoded by exons 5 - 13 . The hydrophobic domain is homologous to three yeast polypeptides , suggesting that this higher eukaryotic gene could have evolved from recombination between a gene that encoded a soluble nuclear protein and a membrane protein gene similar to those in yeast . These results are the first to demonstrate the structural organization of a vertebrate gene encoding an integral membrane protein of the nuclear envelope that may be a member of a family of polypeptides conserved in evolution . Virtually no information is available on regulation and functions of CD38 . Recently we reported that all - trans - retinoic acid ( ATRA ) is a potent and highly specific inducer of CD38 expression in human promyelocytic leukemia cells . Here we report that ATRA - induced expression of CD38 antigen in myeloid cells is mediated through retinoic acid - alpha receptor ( RAR alpha ) . ATRA failed to induce CD38 expression in a mutant subclone of the HL - 60 myeloid leukemia cell line ( designated HL - 60R ) that is relatively resistant to ATRA - induced granulocytic differentiation . Retroviral vector - mediated transduction of RA receptor ( RAR alpha ) into this HL - 60R subclone completely restored the sensitivity of these cells to ATRA in terms of their ability to express CD38 . In contrast , CD38 expression was not inducible by ATRA in HL - 60R cells , transfected with a functional RAR beta , RAR gamma , or RXR alpha receptor . Induction of CD38 in acute promyelocytic and acute myeloblastic leukemia cells was independent of ATRA - induced cytodifferentiation . Following culture with ATRA , increased CD38 protein levels were also observed in normal CD34 + bone marrow cells , but not on normal circulating granulocytes . From these results , we conclude that CD38 is ATRA inducible in myeloid leukemia cells and normal CD34 + bone marrow cells . This effect is independent of differentiation and is mediated by RAR alpha in HL - 60 cells , suggesting a similar role for RAR alpha in CD38 expression in other hematopoietic cells . Some antioxidants , including butylated hydroxyanisole ( BHA ) , tetrahydropapaveroli ( THP ) , nordihydroguiauretic acid , and 10 , 11 - dihydroxyaporphine ( DHA ) , were found to be potent inhibitors of the production of tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - alpha , IL - 1 beta , and IL - 6 by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) stimulated by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) ( IC50s in the low micromolar range ) . Inhibition of cytokine production by PBMC was observed also when other inducers were used ( staphylococci , silica , zymosan ) . The active compounds did not inhibit IL - 1 - induced production of IL - 6 in fibroblasts , showing the cell selectivity of the effect . Antioxidant - mediated inhibition of cytokine production was correlated with low levels of the corresponding messenger RNAs . Nuclear run - on experiments showed that THP inhibited transcription of the IL - 1 beta gene . THP decreased the concentration of the transcription factors NF - kappa B and AP - 1 detected in nuclear extracts of PBMC cultured in the presence or absence of LPS . THP and DHA markedly decreased the levels of TNF - alpha and IL - 1 beta in the circulation of mice following LPS injection . Coordinate inhibition of the transcription of genes for inflammatory cytokines could provide a strategy for therapy of diseases with inflammatory pathogenesis and for septic shock . An interleukin - 4 - induced transcription factor : IL - 4 Stat . Interleukin - 4 ( IL - 4 ) is an immunomodulatory cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes , basophils , and mast cells . It plays an important role in modulating the balance of T helper ( Th ) cell subsets , favoring expansion of the Th2 lineage relative to Th1 . Imbalance of these T lymphocyte subsets has been implicated in immunological diseases including allergy , inflammation , and autoimmune disease . IL - 4 may mediate its biological effects , at least in part , by activating a tyrosine - phosphorylated DNA binding protein . Study of the inhibitory activities of phosphotyrosine - containing peptides derived from the intracellular domain of the IL - 4 receptor provided evidence for direct coupling of receptor and transcription factor during the IL - 4 Stat activation cycle . Evaluation of the respiratory epithelium of normals and individuals with cystic fibrosis for the presence of adenovirus E1a sequences relevant to the use of E1a - adenovirus vectors for gene therapy for the respiratory manifestations of cystic fibrosis . For safety reasons , the Ad vectors are rendered replication deficient by deletion of the E1a region . Because there is the theoretical possibility of an E1a - replication - deficient vector replicating as a result of recombination or complementation with Ad 2 / 5 E1a sequences present in the target cell , this study is directed toward evaluating respiratory epithelium of normals and individuals with CF for the presence of E1a sequences . Using Ad 2 / 5 E1a - specific primers and the polymerase chain reaction to evaluate DNA recovered from freshly isolated nasal and bronchial epithelium recovered by brushing , E1a sequences were detected in respiratory epithelium of 19 of 91 normals ( 21 % ) . In CF individuals , 7 of 52 ( 13 % ) had detectable E1a sequences in the respiratory epithelium , with E1a copy number in the positive samples of 80 + / - 21 / 10 ( 3 ) recovered cells . These results demonstrate that there are detectable Ad 2 / 5 E1a sequences in the respiratory epithelium of a small percentage of normals and individuals with CF . Because of the theoretical potential of such sequences supporting replication of E1a - Ad vectors , human gene therapy protocols for CF utilizing such vectors should consider evaluating study individuals for the presence of Ad 2 / 5 E1a sequences in the respiratory epithelium . Leiomyosarcoma of the vulva : report of a case . A 52 - year - old female presented with a progressively enlarging vulvar mass . Pathological evaluation revealed a high - grade vulvar leiomyosarcoma . Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies were performed to support the diagnosis . In an effort to better understand the biology of this tumor additional immunohistochemical studies for the protein product of p53 tumor suppressor gene and estrogen receptor expression by tumor cells , as well as the type of immune cells infiltrating the tumor were performed . Macrophages and T and B lymphocytes infiltrated the tumor in moderate numbers with occasional lymphoid aggregate formation . This study is the first attempt to better understand the biology of these tumors . Stimulation of HIV replication in mononuclear phagocytes by leukemia inhibitory factor . This study examined the effects of leukemia inhibitory factor ( LIF ) on human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) replication in mononuclear phagocytes ( MNP ) . LIF induced a dose - dependent increase in p24 antigen production in the chronically infected promonocytic cell line U1 . LIF increased steady - state levels of HIV mRNA at 2 . 0 , 4 . 3 , and 9 . 2 kB . This was detectable by 24 h and persisted until 72 h . The DNA binding protein NF - kB is a central mediator in cytokine activation of HIV transcription . NF - kB levels were higher in unstimulated U1 cells as compared to the parent cell line U937 . The oxygen radical scavenger N - acetyl - L - cysteine , but not an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase , inhibited LIF - induced HIV replication . LIF induces the production of other cytokines in monocytes but its effects on HIV replication were not inhibited by antibodies to IL - 1 , TNF , or IL - 6 . These results identify LIF as a stimulus of HIV replication . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) Mechanisms involved in the inhibition of growth of a human B lymphoma cell line , B104 , by anti - MHC class II antibodies . Two anti - MHC class II Ab , L227 and 2 . 06 , inhibited the growth of B104 cells , although 2 . 06 , but not L227 , needed to be further cross - linked with a goat anti - mouse IgG Ab ( GAM ) to show the effect . L227 induced an increase in intracellular free Ca2 + concentration ( [ Ca2 + ] i ) from the intracellular pool and little or no protein tyrosine phosphorylation , phosphatidyl inositol turnover , or expression of Egr - 1 mRNA , whereas 2 . 06 plus GAM induced an increase in [ Ca2 + ] i from both the intracellular and , in particular , the extracellular pools . The inhibition of B104 cell growth induced by anti - MHC class II Ab was Ca ( 2 + ) - independent and not inhibited by actinomycin D or cyclosporin A , and cell cycle arrest at the G2 / M interphase was not observed . These features are very different from those observed in B104 cell death induced by anti - IgM Ab . Neither DNA fragmentation nor the morphology of apoptosis was observed . These findings demonstrate that cross - linking of MHC class II molecules transduced the negative signals through intracellular mechanisms different from those present in the cross - linking of surface IgM . Functional block for 1 alpha , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 - mediated gene regulation in human B lymphocytes . Elements necessary for the steroid hormone 1 alpha , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 alpha , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 ) to induce a biological response include the presence of specific intracellular receptors ( vitamin D3 receptors ( VDR ) ) and modulation of gene expression via hormone - activated receptor binding to regulatory regions of target genes . These parameters were examined in normal and Epstein - Barr virus - immortalized human B cells and compared with 1 alpha , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 - responsive cells of the T and monocytic lineages . Although resting tonsillar B cells did not express VDR mRNA , activation of these cells with interleukin - 4 induced VDR in the absence of exogenously supplemented 1 alpha , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 . As indicators of hormone - mediated gene regulation we analyzed modulation of CD23 , a common B cell / monocyte surface antigen , and 24 - hydroxylase . 1 alpha , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 inhibited CD23 expression in U937 cells , yet failed to modulate CD23 expression in B cells . Furthermore , 1 alpha , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 induced 24 - hydroxylase mRNA expression and metabolic activity in both U937 cells and lectin - activated T cells , yet failed to induce 24 - hydroxylase mRNA or its metabolic activity in B cells . These findings suggest that although human B lymphocytes can express VDR mRNA and protein , they exhibit a functional block for vitamin D - dependent gene regulation . Positive and negative regulation of IL - 2 gene expression : role of multiple regulatory sites . Interleukin 2 ( IL - 2 ) is an important lymphokine required in the process of T cell activation , proliferation , clonal expansion and differentiation . The IL - 2 gene displays both T cell specific and inducible expression : it is only expressed in CD4 + T cells after antigenic or mitogenic stimulation . Several cis - acting regulatory sites are required for induction of the IL - 2 gene after stimulation . In this study , we have analysed the function of these cis - acting regulatory sites in the context of the native IL - 2 enhancer and promoter sequence . The results of this study suggest that the NFAT ( - 276 to - 261 ) , the distal octamer ( - 256 to - 248 ) and the proximal octamer ( - 75 to - 66 ) sites not only act as enhancers of IL - 2 gene transcription in the presence of cellular stimulation , but also have a silencing effect on IL - 2 gene expression in resting cells . Two other sites display disparate effects on IL - 2 gene expression in different T leukemia cell lines : the distal purine box ( - 291 to - 277 ) and the proximal purine box sites ( - 145 to - 128 ) . Finally , the AP - 1 ( - 186 to - 176 ) and the kappa B sites ( - 206 to - 195 ) respond to different cellular activation in EL4 cells . The AP - 1 site mediated the response to PMA stimulation while the kappa B site responded to IL - 1 stimulation . These data suggest that the regulation of IL - 2 gene expression is a complex process and multiple cis - acting regulatory sites interact to exert different effects in T cells representative of alternative stages of differentiation . Sp1 is a critical factor for the monocytic specific expression of human CD14 . CD14 is a membrane glycoprotein expressed specifically on monocytes and macrophages , and its expression is markedly increased during the process of monocyte differentiation . A 5 . 5 - kilobase genomic clone contained the full - length CD14 coding sequence and 4 . 2 kilobases of 5 ' - upstream sequence . One major and one minor transcription start site were identified 101 and 130 base pairs ( bp ) upstream , respectively , from the protein translation start ATG . A DNA fragment containing 128 bp of upstream sequence had strong , monocyte - specific promoter activity in the CD14 positive monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 as compared to the nonmonocytic cell lines HeLa and REX . Mutation of the major Sp1 binding site ( - 110 bp ) decreased tissue - specific promoter activity , and these results , together with transactivation experiments , demonstrate that Sp1 plays a critical role in the tissue - specific expression of CD14 in monocytic cells . CD14 Sp1 site oligonucleotides bound preferentially to a 105 - kDa Sp1 species , which is present in higher relative levels in monocytic than non - monocytic cells , suggesting that modification of Sp1 , such as phosphorylation , may explain how the Sp1 site mediates monocytic specific promoter activity . The interleukin - 8 AP - 1 and kappa B - like sites are genetic end targets of FK506 - sensitive pathway accompanied by calcium mobilization . FK506 , an immunosuppressant , inhibits the production of several cytokines in T lymphocytes . We observed that FK506 suppressed the transcription of a chemotactic cytokine , interleukin - 8 ( IL - 8 ) in a human T cell line , Jurkat cells , activated by phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) and calcium ( Ca2 + ) ionophore ( ionomycin ) . By deleted and mutated analysis of the IL - 8 promoters , the AP - 1 and kappa B - like sites were identified as the responsive elements for PMA and ionomycin . FK506 suppressed the transcriptions through the AP - 1 or kappa B - like sites induced by PMA plus Ca ( 2 + ) - mobilizing agents , but not those induced by Ca ( 2 + ) - independent stimuli . In gel retardation analysis , FK506 had little effect on the binding to the AP - 1 site of PMA / ionomycin - induced nuclear factors , which were recognized with anti - JunD or c - Fos antibody . In contrast , FK506 or EGTA ( Ca2 + chelator ) similarly affected the formation of kappa B - like site binding complexes , which were not recognized by any antibodies against the human Rel family proteins ( c - Rel , p65 , p50 , and p49 ) . Furthermore , we confirmed the previous report that FK506 suppressed the PMA / ionomycin - induced activation through authentic kappa B site of immunoglobulin ( Ig ) gene , to which NF - kappa B binding was also decreased by FK506 , indicating that both IL - 8 kappa B - like site and Ig kappa B site are FK506 - sensitive in spite of the difference of binding factors . Our results indicate that not only the reported IL - 2 NF - AT and NFIL - 2A sites and Ig kappa B site , but also the IL - 8 AP - 1 and kappa B - like sites are terminals of FK506 - sensitive pathway involving Ca2 + mobilization . Androgen binding sites in peripheral human mononuclear leukocytes of healthy males and females . Androgen binding sites have been identified in circulating human mononuclear leukocytes of healthy donors of both sexes . Cells were separated from blood samples on a Ficoll gradient and incubated with different concentrations of [ 3H ] testosterone in the presence or absence of a 400 - fold excess of unlabelled testosterone . The binding sites fulfil the required criteria for specific steroid binding sites however differ somewhat from the classic androgen receptors from genital skin fibroblast : in fertile adult males ( n = 20 ) the binding sites showed ( 1 ) a high affinity for testosterone ( 1 . 32 + / - 0 . 49 nM ; mean + / - SD ) , ( 2 ) a saturable capacity ( 184 + / - 52 binding sites per cell ; mean + / - SD ) , and ( 3 ) a characteristic competitive binding profile for other steroid hormones ( relative binding affinities : testosterone = dihydrotestosterone > 17 beta - estradiol > progesterone , whereas aldosterone , 17 - hydroxy - progesterone and cortisol did not compete appreciably ) . Furthermore the number of binding sites determined using [ 3H ] dihydrotestosterone , [ 3H ] RU - 1881 , or [ 3H ] testosterone were comparable . This raises the possibility that androgen receptors in peripheral mononuclear leukocytes differ from those in genital skin fibroblasts . There was no apparent correlation between serum testosterone concentrations and androgen binding sites . The presence of androgen receptors in peripheral mononuclear leukocytes provides for the first time the experimental basis for an hypothesis of direct , receptor - mediated effects of androgens on mature immunocompetent cells . Induction of IL - 8 expression in T cells uses the CD28 costimulatory pathway . IL - 8 , a potent chemotactic factor for neutrophil granulocytes and lymphocytes , is a proinflammatory cytokine secreted by a variety of cell types , including T cells . Anti - CD28 - stimulated T cells produced significant amounts of IL - 8 ; additionally , costimulation with anti - CD3 and anti - CD28 Abs resulted in a synergistic induction of IL - 8 secretion . Sequence homology , single nucleotide mutations , and anti - CD28 Ab stimulation studies established that the NF - kappa B - like sequence in the promoter of the IL - 8 gene functioned as a CD28 response element . Furthermore , cyclosporin A , but not rapamycin , blocked the synergistic induction of IL - 8 expression achieved with anti - CD3 and anti - CD28 costimulation . The involvement of a CD28 response element in the induction of IL - 8 expression in activated T cells may provide new insights into the pathogenesis and persistence of immune disorders characterized by increased levels of IL - 8 , such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis . MHC class II signaling in B - cell activation [ see comments ] The cognate interaction between T cells and antigen - presenting cells ( APCs ) , mediated by major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II molecules , results in the delivery of activation signals to the APC . These signals contribute to the expression of co - stimulatory activity by APCs and have important consequences for cell effector function . MHC class II molecules also serve as receptors for B - cell stimulation by microbial superantigens . In this review , Paul Scholl and Raif Geha discuss recent advances in our understanding of mechanisms of MHC class II signaling and analyse their role in human B - cell activation . Effects of glucocorticoids in rheumatoid arthritis . OBJECTIVE . Lymphocytes of patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) have diminished receptor density ; thus , patients with RA should show partial resistance to glucocorticoids . We investigated the glucocorticoid sensitivity of lymphocytes in RA patients compared with healthy subjects . METHODS . We determined the effects of glucocorticoids on lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine release . RESULTS . Proliferation and cytokine release were inhibited in RA patients to the same extent as in healthy controls . CONCLUSION . Diminished receptor density in RA patients does not result in glucocorticoid resistance . Arrested development : understanding v - abl . The protein tyrosine kinase activity of the v - abl oncogene has been demonstrated to subvert the normal second messenger systems used by lymphoid cells for growth and differentiation . Transformation of bone marrow with the Abelson murine leukemia virus results in the appearance of B cell lineage cells arrested at the pre - B cell stage . Recent reports have characterized these cells expressing high v - abl kinase activity as deficient in detectable NF - kappaB DNA binding activity and low level RAG gene expression . These observations suggest that v - abl may be inhibiting the differentiation of B cells by blocking these two crucial elements in the maturation pathway . Corticosteroid receptors in lymphocytes : a possible marker of brain involution ? A similarity has recently been found between the regulation of corticosteroid receptors in brain and in lymphoid tissue . We have studied the regulation of corticosteroid receptors in human mononuclear leukocytes as a possible marker of brain involution . Type I corticosteroid receptors are down regulated by excess of mineralocorticoids ( primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism , pseudohyperaldostero ) and of glucocorticoids ( Cushing ' s syndrome ) . Type II corticosteroid receptors are not reduced by excess of endogenous corticosteroids ( Cushing ' s syndrome ) . In normal adults there is a direct significant correlation between plasma cortisol and Type I and between plasma cortisol and Type II receptors in mononuclear leukocytes , while in Cushing ' s syndrome the correlation is inverse between plasma cortisol at 8 a . m . and Type II receptors . In an aged population the mean numbers of Type I and of Type II receptors are lower and plasma cortisol is higher than in adult controls , but the increase of plasma cortisol is not followed by a clinical picture of hypercorticism . After dexamethasone suppression ( 1 mg at 11 p . m . ) Type I receptors always decrease in controls while the response of Type II is not homogeneous . In an aged group of patients , both receptors are reduced by dexamethasone . We conclude that the decrease with age of corticosteroid receptors is possibly related to a physiological involution of corticosteroid receptors and that this reduction does increase plasma cortisol concentration , without affecting the glucocorticoid effector mechanism . All - trans retinoic acid ( RA ) induces differentiation of HL60 cells to neutrophils and is used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia . We observed that RA did not induced neutrophil differentiation in serum - free grown HL60 cells whereas 50 nM 1 alpha , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( D3 ) induced maximal monocyte differentiation . Increasing RA concentrations reduced the D3 concentration required for monocyte differentiation . Cells treated with 5 nM D3 showed little response , but differentiated maximally with 5 nM D3 and 10 nM RA . The D3 analogs MC903 , EB1089 and KH1060 were more potent inducers of monocyte differentiation . The extent to which analog activity was increased after cotreatment with RA was inversely related to potency . Twenty - four hour treatment with 10 nM RA primed cells for response to 5 nM D3 ; the reverse sequence being ineffective . Priming with 10 nM RA , or subsequent treatment with D3 ( 5 nM ) , did not alter expression of mRNAs encoding receptors for D3 ( VDR ) , RA ( RAR alpha ) or 9 - CIS RA ( RXR alpha , beta , gamma ) . [ An overexpression of retinoic acid receptor alpha blocks myeloid cell differentiation at the promyelocyte stage ] Retinoic acid ( RA ) , a vitamin A derivative , exerts a wide range of biological effects related to cell proliferation and differentiation . The pleiotropic effects of RA are thought to be mediated through specific nuclear RA receptors ( RARs ) . RARs are members of the steroid / thyroid hormone receptor superfamily and exhibit a molecular structure that possess discrete DNA - binding and RA ( ligand ) - binding domains . In hematopoietic system , RA and RARs , predominantly RAR alpha may play key roles for the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors . However , it is currently unknown how RA and RARs are involved in regulating normal hematopoietic differentiation . To make clear the roles of RA and RAR alpha in the normal hematopoiesis , I have introduced the construct of human RAR alpha ( hRAR alpha ) into murine bone marrow cells with retroviral vector , and selected infected cells with drug resistant marker ( Neo ( r ) ) cultured on the stroma cell line ( PA6 - neo ) , and analyzed the behavior of infected cells . All of procedure were done in vitro . Most cells infected with hRAR alpha exhibited promyelocytic morphology and were thought to be blocked at the promyelocytic stage in their myeloid differentiation . Furthermore , these immature cells differentiated terminally into mature granulocytes by adding with RA ( 10 ( - 6 ) M ) . RAR alpha infected cells were also able to differentiate into mature macrophages in the both of long term culture and IL3 colony . These observations suggest that an overexpression of RAR alpha alone is effective to suppress myeloid cell differentiation and RAR alpha plays a crucial role in the terminal differentiation of myeloid precursors . The system described here may serve as a model for studying the the essential genes for differentiation of normal bone marrow cells . Hypoxic induction of interleukin - 8 gene expression in human endothelial cells . Because leukocyte - mediated tissue damage is an important component of the pathologic picture in ischemia / reperfusion , we have sought mechanisms by which PMNs are directed into hypoxic tissue . Incubation of human endothelial cells ( ECs ) in hypoxia , PO2 approximately 14 - 18 Torr , led to time - dependent release of IL - 8 antigen into the conditioned medium ; this was accompanied by increased chemotactic activity for PMNs , blocked by antibody to IL - 8 . Production of IL - 8 by hypoxic ECs occurred concomitantly with both increased levels of IL - 8 mRNA , based on polymerase chain reaction analysis , and increased IL - 8 transcription , based on nuclear run - on assays . Northern analysis of mRNA from hypoxic ECs also demonstrated increased levels of mRNA for macrophage chemotactic protein - 1 , another member of the chemokine superfamily of proinflammatory cytokines . IL - 8 gene induction was associated with the presence of increased binding activity in nuclear extracts from hypoxic ECs for the NF - kB site . Studies with human umbilical vein segments exposed to hypoxia also demonstrated increased elaboration of IL - 8 antigen compared with normoxic controls . In mice exposed to hypoxia ( PO2 approximately 30 - 40 Torr ) , there was increased pulmonary leukostasis , as evidenced by increased myeloperoxidase activity in tissue homogenates . In parallel , increased levels of transcripts for IP - 10 , a murine homologue in the chemokine family related to IL - 8 , were observed in hypoxic lung tissue . Taken together , these data suggest that hypoxia constitutes a stimulus for leukocyte chemotaxis and tissue leukostasis . Thrombin stimulation of the T leukemic cell line Jurkat induced a transient increase in [ Ca2 + ] i . Proteolytic activity of the enzyme was required for this effect since diisopropyl fluorophosphate - thrombin failed to increase [ Ca2 + ] i . Furthermore , hirudin and anti - thrombin III inhibited the thrombin - induced [ Ca2 + ] i rise in Jurkat T cells . A synthetic thrombin receptor agonist peptide ( TRP ) of 7 residues ( SFLLRNP ) was found to be as effective as thrombin for [ Ca2 + ] i mobilization , and both agonists induced Ca2 + release exclusively from internal stores . Thrombin stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins of molecular mass 40 , 42 , 70 , 120 , and 130 kDa . Thrombin and TRP also caused translocation of protein kinase C from the cytosol to the plasma membrane . As a likely consequence of these events , thrombin activated the nuclear factor NF - kB . Several cell lines of hematopoietic origin including the leukemic T cell line HPB . ALL and the erythroleukemic cell line K562 were responsive to thrombin , whereas others such as THP1 , a myelomonocytic cell line , and BL2 , a Burkitt lymphoma were refractory to thrombin or TRP stimulation . The magnitude of the thrombin response in the different cell types paralleled the expression of the thrombin receptor mRNA . We found that activation of Jurkat T cells by a combination of phytohemagglutinin and phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate led to a dramatic inhibition of thrombin receptor mRNA expression and to a concomitant loss of the thrombin response . Finally , we demonstrate that thrombin and TRP enhanced CD69 expression and interleukin 2 production induced by T cell receptor cross - linking in both Jurkat T cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes . These findings highlight the role of thrombin as a potential regulator of T lymphocyte activation . A second feature of senescent T cells is the dramatic reduction in hsp70 production in response to heat shock . This decline is associated with a decrease in binding of nuclear extracts to the consensus heat shock element . This suggests that for senescent T cells the reduced ability to respond to heat shock by producing hsp70 , although possibly lying at the level of transcriptional control , may nevertheless be unrelated to the reduced DNA synthesis or the diminished proliferative activity also manifested by these cells . Involvement of phospholipase D in the activation of transcription factor AP - 1 in human T lymphoid Jurkat cells . The induction of the AP - 1 transcription factor has been ascribed to the early events leading to T lymphocyte activation . We have examined the possibility that stimulation of phospholipase D ( PLD ) may regulate activation of transcription factor AP - 1 in human T cells by transfecting human T lymphocyte Jurkat cells with a plasmid containing an AP - 1 enhancer element and a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene . We have detected activatable PLD in Jurkat cells , and we have found that addition of phosphatidic acid ( PA ) , the physiologic product of PLD action on phospholipids , is rapidly incorporated into Jurkat cells and leads to activation of transcription factor AP - 1 . Treatment of Jurkat cells with anti - CD3 mAb activated both PLD and transcription factor AP - 1 . Furthermore , ethanol , an inhibitor of the PLD pathway , blocked the anti - CD3 - stimulated AP - 1 enhancer activity . However , this anti - CD3 - mediated response was not inhibited by neomycin , an inhibitor of phosphoinositide hydrolysis . The increases in AP - 1 enhancer activity induced by PA or anti - CD3 mAb were efficiently abrogated by the presence of propranolol , an inhibitor of PA phosphohydrolase and protein kinase C ( PKC ) . Furthermore , the PA - and the anti - CD3 - induced increases in AP - 1 enhancer activity were blocked by the presence of PKC inhibitors or by PKC down - regulation . These data indicate that PLD stimulation can activate the transcription factor AP - 1 in T lymphocytes , and suggest that the induction of AP - 1 enhancer factor activity by PA is mediated via PKC stimulation , either through a direct activating effect of PA or through PA - derived diacylglycerol formation . These data also provide evidence for a role of PLD - derived lipids in the induction of AP - 1 enhancer activity resulting from stimulation of the TCR / CD3 complex , suggesting that increased PLD activity can play an important role in T lymphocyte activation . Upregulation of bcl - 2 by the Epstein - Barr virus latent membrane protein LMP1 : a B - cell - specific response that is delayed relative to NF - kappa B activation and to induction of cell surface markers . An ability of the Epstein - Barr virus latent membrane protein LMP1 to enhance the survival of infected B cells through upregulation of the bcl - 2 oncogene was first suggested by experiments involving gene transfection and the selection of stable LMP1 + clones ( S . Henderson , M . Rowe , C . Gregory , F . Wang , E . Kieff , and A . Rickinson , Cell 65 : 1107 - 1115 , 1991 ) . However , it was not possible to ascertain whether Bcl - 2 upregulation was a specific consequence of LMP1 expression or an artifact of the selection procedure whereby rare Bcl - 2 + cells already present in the starting population might best be able to tolerate the potentially toxic effects of LMP1 . In the first approach , stable clones of two B - cell lines carrying an LMP1 gene under the control of an inducible metallothionein promoter were induced to express LMP1 in all cells . Activation of NK - kappa B and upregulation of ICAM - 1 occurred within 24 h and were followed at 48 to 72 h by upregulation of Bcl - 2 . All six B - cell lines tested showed NF - kappa B activation in response to LMP1 expression , and this was followed in five of six lines by expression of ICAM - 1 and Bcl - 2 . We therefore conclude that Bcl - 2 upregulation is part of the panoply of cellular changes induced by LMP1 but that the effect is cell type specific . Our data also suggest that whilst NF - kappa B may be an essential component of LMP1 signal transduction , other cell - specific factors may be required to effect some functions of the viral protein . Long - term inositol phosphate release , but not tyrosine kinase activity , correlates with IL - 2 secretion and NF - AT induction in anti - CD3 - activated peripheral human T lymphocytes . The cascade of events within the first few minutes of T cell stimulation has been well characterized . Although many second messengers have been shown to be necessary and sufficient for T cell activation in a number of model systems , the rate - limiting step in peripheral T cells has not been demonstrated . To model effective versus ineffective CD3 - mediated stimulation in peripheral T cells , we used two anti - CD3 mAbs that differ in their ability to stimulate purified T cells : OKT3 , which causes early second messenger generation but is unable to activate T cells without a second signal , and 64 . 1 , which stimulates T cell proliferation on its own . However , only 64 . 1 induced NF - AT in the nucleus , correlating with its ability to activate T cells . Thus , NF - AT induction and IL - 2 secretion were correlated with the levels of inositol phosphate release but not with gross levels of tyrosine kinase activity induced late following the response . On the other hand , NF - kappa B induction and IL - 2 receptor expression occurred even with the smaller second messenger response generated by OKT3 . HLA - DR - , CD33 + , CD56 + , CD16 - myeloid / natural killer cell acute leukemia : a previously unrecognized form of acute leukemia potentially misdiagnosed as French - American - British acute myeloid leukemia - M3 [ see comments ] We have identified and characterized a previously unrecognized form of acute leukemia that shares features of both myeloid and natural killer ( NK ) cells . Multicolor flow cytometric assays confirmed the coexpression of myeloid ( CD33 , CD13 , CD15 ) and NK cell - associated ( CD56 ) antigens in each case , whereas reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) assays confirmed the identity of CD56 ( neural cell adhesion molecule ) in leukemic blasts . Although two cases expressed CD4 , no case expressed CD2 , CD3 , or CD8 and no case showed clonal rearrangement of genes encoding the T - cell receptor ( TCR beta , gamma , delta ) . Leukemic blasts in the majority of cases shared unique morphologic features ( deeply invaginated nuclear membranes , scant cytoplasm with fine azurophilic granularity , and finely granular Sudan black B and myeloperoxidase cytochemical reactivity ) that were remarkably similar to those of acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) ; particularly the microgranular variant ( FAB AML - M3v ) . However , all 20 cases lacked the t ( 15 ; 17 ) and 17 cases tested lacked the promyelocytic / retinoic acid receptor alpha ( RAR alpha ) fusion transcript in RT - PCR assays ; 12 cases had 46 , XX or 46 , XY karyotypes , whereas 2 cases had abnormalities of chromosome 17q : 1 with del ( 17 ) ( q25 ) and the other with t ( 11 ; 17 ) ( q23 ; q21 ) and the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger / RAR alpha fusion transcript . All cases tested ( 6 / 20 ) , including the case with t ( 11 ; 17 ) , failed to differentiate in vitro in response to all - trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) , suggesting that these cases may account for some APLs that have not shown a clinical response to ATRA . Four of 6 cases tested showed functional NK cell - mediated cytotoxicity , suggesting a relationship between these unique CD33 + , CD56 + , CD16 - acute leukemias and normal CD56 + , CD16 - NK precursor cells . Using a combination of panning and multiparameter flow cytometric sorting , we identified a normal CD56 + , CD33 + , CD16 - counterpart cell at a frequency of 1 % to 2 % in the peripheral blood of healthy individuals . Our studies suggest that this form of acute leukemia may arise from transformation of a precursor cell common to both the myeloid and NK cell lineages ; thus we propose the designation myeloid / NK acute leukemia . Recognition of this new leukemic entity will be important in distinguishing these ATRA - nonresponsive cases from ATRA - responsive true APL . IL - 4 down - regulates IL - 2 - , IL - 3 - , and GM - CSF - induced cytokine gene expression in peripheral blood monocytes . IL - 4 , a product of the T - helper 0 ( Th0 ) and 2 ( Th2 ) subset , was originally described as a B - cell stimulatory factor and has subsequently been found to suppress IL - 1 alpha , IL - 1 beta , IL - 6 , IL - 8 , and TNF - alpha gene expression in monocytes stimulated with LPS , and to upregulate IL - 1 receptor antagonist ( IL1 - RA ) gene expression . In this study we investigated the effect of IL - 4 on the expression of cytokine genes in monocytes evoked by other T - helper cell cytokines : IL - 2 , IL - 3 , and GM - CSF . IL - 4 down - regulated mRNA accumulation of the proinflammatory cytokines IL - 1 beta , IL - 8 , and TNF - alpha in monocytes stimulated with IL - 2 , IL - 3 , and GM - CSF . IL - 4 also suppressed the IL - 2 - induced IL - 6 mRNA expression . Temporal analysis of the IL - 4 down - regulatory effect on the IL - 2 - , IL - 3 - , or GM - CSF - induced proinflammatory cytokine gene expression in monocytes provided evidence that IL - 4 acts predominantly on the post - transcriptional level . IL - 4 did not exert significant influence on the induction of expression of IL - 1 - RA or various CSFs by IL - 2 , IL - 3 , and GM - CSF . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) Induction of proto - oncogene and cytokine expression in human peripheral blood monocytes and the monocytic cell line THP - 1 after stimulation with mycoplasma - derived material MDHM . Mycoplasma fermentans - derived high - molecular - weight material ( MDHM ) was originally described to induce differentiation of murine thymocytes to cytolytic effector T - cells by stimulating IL - 6 release from adherent cells . This study shows that human peripheral blood monocytes ( PBMo ) also respond to MDHM with increases in IL - 1 beta , IL - 6 and TNF alpha expression , both at the mRNA and protein level . The induced expression of IL - 1 beta and TNF alpha mRNA in the monocytic THP - 1 cell line increased as quickly as in primary cells . In contrast to PBMo , THP - 1 and 14 other monocytic / myeloid leukemia - derived cell lines did not secrete measurable amounts of the cytokines upon treatment with MDHM . IL - 1 beta and IL - 6 genes contain AP - 1 binding sites as regulatory elements , the AP - 1 protein being composed of c - jun and c - fos gene products . In THP - 1 cells c - jun mRNA expression increased after incubation with MDHM while positive c - fos expression remained unaffected . In the primary cells MDHM - induced elevation of cytokine mRNA levels was preceded by a downregulation of c - fos expression while positive c - jun expression was not modulated . c - myc mRNA expression , constitutively high in THP - 1 cells , was induced in MDHM - stimulated PBMo . In conclusion , MDHM - stimulated induction of cytokine mRNA expression was accompanied by different proto - oncogene responses in PBMo and THP - 1 cells . Alternatively , these data support the notion that neither AP - 1 nor the c - myc protein are involved in the MDHM - induced increase in IL - 1 beta , IL - 6 or TNF alpha mRNA levels . Fast in vitro effects of aldosterone on the Na + / H ( + ) - exchanger , inositoltrisphosphat generation and corresponding specific binding to plasma membranes at Kd - values of approximately 0 . 1 nM have been found in human mononuclear leukocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells . This aldosterone - selectivity is typical and discriminatory for the new aldosterone membrane receptor . Solubilization of the receptor protein from membranes by high salt concentrations ( 1 M NaCl , 1 mM EDTA ) was not achieved . Dithiothreitol , a sulfhydryl agent , does not reduce specific aldosterone binding indicating the absence of SH - groups in the binding domain or sensitive structures of the receptors . The results are the first to characterize the novel membrane receptor for aldosterone with regard to molecular weight and basic properties . These findings and other related results are reviewed here . A transcriptional regulatory element is associated with a nuclease - hypersensitive site in the pol gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 . In the present report , high - resolution mapping of this site with DNase I and micrococcal nuclease identified a nucleosome - free region centered around nucleotides ( nt ) 4490 to 4766 . A 500 - bp fragment encompassing this hypersensitive site ( nt 4481 to 4982 ) exhibited transcription - enhancing activity ( two - to threefold ) when it was cloned in its natural position with respect to the HIV - 1 promoter after transient transfection in U937 and CEM cells . Using in vitro footprinting and gel shift assays , we have identified four distinct binding sites for nuclear proteins within this positive regulatory element . Site B ( nt 4519 to 4545 ) specifically bound four distinct nuclear protein complexes : a ubiquitous factor , a T - cell - specific factor , a B - cell - specific factor , and the monocyte / macrophage - and B - cell - specific transcription factor PU . 1 / Spi - 1 . In most HIV - 1 isolates in which this PU box was not conserved , it was replaced by a binding site for the related factor Ets1 . Factors binding to site C ( nt 4681 to 4701 ) had a DNA - binding specificity similar to that of factors binding to site B , except for PU . 1 / Spi - 1 . A GC box containing a binding site for Sp1 was identified ( nt 4623 to 4631 ) . These results identify a transcriptional regulatory element associated with a nuclease - hypersensitive site in the pol gene of HIV - 1 and suggest that its activity may be controlled by a complex interplay of cis - regulatory elements . Expression of v - src in T cells correlates with nuclear expression of NF - kappa B . Protein tyrosine kinases transmit signals from cytokine and immune receptors . Very little information exists linking these two important classes of signaling molecules . We now demonstrate that v - src expression correlates with nuclear expression of a kappa B binding complex similar to that induced by phorbol ester and ionomycin , as detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a variety of kappa B sites . This complex was blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor , herbimycin A . The v - src - induced complex comprised the p50 and p65 components of NF - kappa B , as determined by supershift and immunoblot analysis . As a functional correlate of this finding , transient co - transfection of HIV - 1 LTR reporter constructs in a different T cell line demonstrated that v - src activated this promoter in a kappa B - dependent manner . We found that transactivation of the HIV - 1 LTR by v - src was more sensitive to mutations of the proximal , rather than the distal , kappa B element . The implications for T cell receptor signaling and HIV - 1 gene expression are considered . trans - activation of the HIV promoter by a cDNA and its genomic clones of human herpesvirus - 6 . Co - infection of T cells by HIV - 1 and HHV - 6 can lead to both activation of the HIV - 1 promoter and acceleration of the cytopathic effects . An HHV - 6 ( GS ) cDNA clone , pCD41 , encoding for a 41 - kDa nuclear protein was identified and characterized previously ( Chang and Balachandran , J . Virol . 65 , 2884 - 2894 and 7085 , 1991 ) . Using this cDNA as the probe , a 3 . 8 - kb EcoRI genomic fragment encoding the HHV - 6 ( GS ) P41 was cloned and designated as pGD41 . When cotransfected with the HIV LTR CAT into CV - 1 cells , both the pCD41 and pGD41 clones trans - activated the HIV LTR . Deletion constructs of the pCD41 clone demonstrated that ORF - A was critical for the HIV LTR activation . Deletion analyses of the pCD41 ORF - A and the use of promoter constructs further mapped an internal functional promoter within the pCD41 sequence that can direct the synthesis of the trans - activating protein . By using HIV LTR deletion mutants , the NF - kappa B binding sites were found to be critical for response to the pCD41 trans - activation . During the course of serious bacterial infections , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) is believed to interact with macrophage receptors , resulting in the generation of inflammatory mediators and systemic symptoms including hemodynamic instability and shock . CD14 , a glycosylphosphatidyl - linked antigen , functions as an LPS signaling receptor . A critical issue concerns the mechanism by which CD14 , which has no transmembrane domain , transduces its signal following LPS binding . Recently , investigators have hypothesized that CD14 - mediated signaling is effected through a receptor - associated tyrosine kinase ( TK ) , suggesting a multicomponent receptor model of LPS signaling . Wild - type Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) - K1 cells can be activated by endotoxin to release arachidonate following transfection with human CD14 ( CHO / CD14 ) . We sought to determine if this pathway were present in CHO / CD14 cells and to elucidate the relationship of NF - kappa B activation to the CD14 receptor system . Protein synthesis inhibitors and corticosteroids , which suppress arachidonate release and the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines , had no effect on translocation of NF - kappa B in CHO / CD14 or RAW 264 . 7 cells , demonstrating that NF - kappa B translocation is an early event . Although TK activity was consistently observed by immunoblotting extracts from activated RAW 264 . 7 cells , LPS - induced phosphotyrosine residues were not observed from similarly treated CHO / CD14 cells . Furthermore , the TK inhibitors herbimycin A and genistein failed to inhibit translocation of NF - kappa B in CHO / CD14 or RAW 264 . 7 cells , although both of these agents inhibited LPS - induced TK activity in RAW 264 . 7 cells . These results imply that TK activity is not obligatory for CD14 - mediated signal transduction to occur in response to LPS . Signals transduced through the CD4 molecule on T lymphocytes activate NF - kappa B . We have demonstrated that native envelope glycoproteins of HIV - 1 , gp160 can induce activation of the transcription factor , NF - kappa B . The gp160 - induced NF - kappa B complex consists of p65 , p50 and c - rel proteins . The gp160 - mediated activation of NF - kappa B in CD4 positive T cells may be involved in biological effects , e . g . , enhanced HIV replication , hypergammaglobulinem , increased cytokine secretion , hypercellularity in bone marrow and apoptosis . The expression of the progesterone receptor in human peripheral blood lymphocytes was analysed , using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ( Abbott PgR - EIA monoclonal ) , in order to evaluate its prognostic character in the context of spontaneous abortion . Cytosols were prepared from lymphocytes of 24 healthy pregnant women ( 11 first , 10 second and three third trimester ) , seven healthy non - pregnant women , nine women with recurrent spontaneous abortion , and six healthy men . In addition , a human breast carcinoma cell line ( ZR - 75 - 1 ) , which expresses the progesterone receptor , was analysed throughout . The ZR - 75 - 1 cell line showed an expression of 642 fmol / mg whereas lymphocytes of pregnant women showed an expression < or = 4 fmol / mg . Lymphocytes of non - pregnant women , women with threatened pre - term delivery , and men showed equivalent levels : 3 + / - 1 , 3 + / - 2 and 5 + / - 4 fmol / mg respectively . These results show that there is no evidence of specific expression of the progesterone receptor in pregnancy and exclude any prognostic character in spontaneous abortion . Tolerance to lipopolysaccharide involves mobilization of nuclear factor kappa B with predominance of p50 homodimers . Stimulation of the human monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) leads to rapid and transient expression of cytokines like tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) . When such cells are precultured for 2 days with a low dose of LPS ( 20 ng / ml ) followed by stimulation with a high dose of LPS ( 1 microgram / ml ) , expression of the TNF gene is minimal , i . e . the cells are tolerant . Reporter gene analysis reveals that the NF - kappa B complex mobilized in tolerant cells is functionally inactive in that NF - kappa B - dependent luciferase constructs containing the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat or the TNF 5 ' - region show only minimal transactivation after LPS stimulation . Similar to Mono Mac 6 cells , primary blood monocytes , when precultured with a low dose of LPS , also become tolerant and produce little TNF after LPS stimulation . The tolerant blood monocytes also up - regulate CD14 , and they mobilize NF - kappa B with a predominance of p50 homodimers . Taken together , these results demonstrate that tolerance to LPS is determined by post - receptor mechanisms that involve an altered composition of the NF - kappa B complex . The frequency of Oct2 - positive clones was 1 / 15 , 000 in both libraries . Two new isoforms were found that generate novel amino - or carboxy - terminal sequences . An isoform lacking exon 11 destroyed the carboxy - terminal leucin - zipper region and introduced a frame shift creating a novel , proline - rich carboxy terminus . This exon was inserted between glutamine - rich regions 2 and 3 , carboxy terminal of a tentative leucine - zipper structure . More frequent use of the classical Oct2a and Oct2b isoforms was observed in the lipopolysaccharide - stimulated B cells , while a preference for the Oct2ab and Oct2ba isoforms was observed in lipopolysaccharide plus phorbol - di - butyrate - treated cells . The zinc finger transcription factor GATA - 1 is a major regulator of gene expression in erythroid , megakaryocyte , and mast cell lineages . GATA - 1 binds to WGATAR consensus motifs in the regulatory regions of virtually all erythroid cell - specific genes . Targeted mutagenesis of the GATA - 1 gene in embryonic stem cells has demonstrated its requirement in normal erythroid development . Efficient rescue of the defect requires an intact GATA element in the distal promoter , suggesting autoregulatory control of GATA - 1 transcription . To examine whether GATA - 1 expression involves additional regulatory factors or is maintained entirely by an autoregulatory loop , we have used a transient heterokaryon system to test the ability of erythroid factors to activate the GATA - 1 gene in nonerythroid nuclei . We show here that proerythroblasts and mature erythroid cells contain a diffusible activity ( TAG ) capable of transcriptional activation of GATA - 1 and that this activity decreases during the terminal differentiation of erythroid cells . Nuclei from GATA - 1 - mutant embryonic stem cells can still be reprogrammed to express their globin genes in erythroid heterokaryons , indicating that de novo induction of GATA - 1 is not required for globin gene activation following cell fusion . Role of HIV - 1 Nef expression in activation pathways in CD4 + T cells . Secretion of IL - 2 and TNF - alpha , surface expression of IL - 2R , and DNA - binding activity of NF - kappa B and AP - 1 ( Fos / Jun ) complex in response to phorbol myristate acetate , TNF - alpha , or immobilized antibodies to CD3 were monitored . These parameters were not modified by Nef expression in Jurkat cells , whereas stimulation with the same stimuli resulted in partial inhibition of LTR activation in Nef + Jurkat cells . This inhibition was not mediated through Nef phosphorylation on Thr - 15 or GTP - binding activity because mutations in critical sites did not alter this inhibition . Analysis of truncated LTRs confirmed that inhibition of LTR activation was not mediated through NF - kappa B - binding activity but through the region containing the negative responding elements ( NREs ) . These results suggest that Nef downmodulates LTR activation without significantly inhibiting the capacity of T cells to respond to immunological activations . Tat - binding protein 7 is a subunit of the 26S protease . Subunit 6 ( S6 ) , an integral component of the 26S protease from human erythrocytes , has been studied by SDS - PAGE , peptide mapping and sequence analysis . S6 was cleaved with CNBr and three internal peptides were sequenced . A comparison with known proteins in Genbank revealed that all three S6 peptides match the predicted sequence of TBP7 , Tat - binding protein 7 . Based on peptide matches covering more than 10 % of the TBP7 sequence , and the fact that the migration of S6 on SDS - PAGE is consistent with the estimated molecular mass for TBP7 , we conclude that subunit 6 of the 26S protease is TBP7 . Hypoxia causes the activation of nuclear factor kappa B through the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha on tyrosine residues . In this report , we show that exposure of cells to hypoxia ( 0 . 02 % O2 ) results in I kappa B alpha degradation , increased NF - kappa B DNA binding activity , and transactivation of a reporter gene construct containing two NF - kappa B DNA binding sites . Pretreatment of cells with protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors and the dominant negative allele of c - Raf - 1 ( Raf 301 ) inhibited I kappa B alpha degradation , NF - kappa B binding , and transactivation of kappa B reporter constructs by hypoxia . To demonstrate a direct link between changes in the phosphorylation pattern of I kappa B alpha with NF - kappa B activation , we immunoprecipitated I kappa B alpha after varying times of hypoxic exposure and found that its tyrosine phosphorylation status increased during hypoxic exposure . Inhibition of the transfer of tyrosine phosphoryl groups onto I kappa B alpha prevented I kappa B alpha degradation and NF - kappa B binding . These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha during hypoxia is an important proximal step which precedes its dissociation and degradation from NF - kappa B . Overproduction of NFKB2 ( lyt - 10 ) and c - Rel : a mechanism for HTLV - I Tax - mediated trans - activation via the NF - kappa B signalling pathway . The Tax protein of HTLV - I , a positive transcriptional activator of HTLV - I gene expression , is a viral oncogene that also increases transcription of cellular genes including GM - CSF , IL - 2R alpha and IL - 2 . One of the cellular targets of the trans - activating effects of Tax is the NF - kappa B / Rel family of transcription factors , pleiotropic regulators of immunoregulatory , cytokine and viral gene expression . In this report , we demonstrate that NFKB2 ( lyt - 10 ) and c - Rel are overexpressed in HTLV - I infected and Tax - expressing cells and , together , account for the majority of the constitutive NF - kappa B binding activity in these cells before and after PMA stimulation . Most importantly , we show a Tax - dependent correlation between expression of NFKB2 ( p100 ) and processing to the DNA binding NFKB2 ( p52 ) form , induction of c - Rel , and trans - activation of NF - kappa B - mediated gene expression . We propose that NFKB2 synthesis and processing allows continuous nuclear expression of an otherwise cytoplasmic protein and , in conjunction with overexpression of c - Rel , NFKB2 alters the NF - kappa B signalling pathway and contributes to leukemic transformation of T cells by HTLV - I . Retinoic acid downmodulates erythroid differentiation and GATA1 expression in purified adult - progenitor culture . All - trans retinoic acid ( RA ) is an important morphogen in vertebrate development , a normal constituent in human adult blood and is also involved in the control of cell growth and differentiation in acute promyelocytic leukemia . In clonogenetic fetal calf serum - supplemented ( FCS + ) or - nonsupplemented ( FCS - ) culture treated with saturating levels of interleukin - 3 ( IL - 3 ) granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) and erythropoietin ( Ep ) ( combined with c - kit ligand in FCS ( - ) - culture conditions ) , RA induces a dramatic dose - dependent shift from erythroid to granulomonocytic colony formation , the latter colonies being essentially represented by granulocytic clones . This shift is apparently not caused by a recruitment phenomenon , because in FCS + culture , the total number of colonies is not significantly modified by RA addition . In FCS - liquid - suspension culture supplemented with saturating Ep level and low - dose IL - 3 / GM - CSF , adult HPC undergo unilineage erythropoietic differentiation : Here again , treatment with high - dose RA induces a shift from the erythroid to granulocytic differentiation pathway . Studies on RA time - response or pulse treatment in semisolid or liquid culture show that early RA addition is most effective , thus indicating that early but not late HPC are sensitive to its action . We then analyzed the expression of the master GATA1 gene , which encodes a finger transcription factor required for normal erythroid development ; addition of RA to HPC stimulated into unilineage erythropoietic differentiation in liquid culture caused a virtually complete inhibition of GATA1 mRNA induction . These results indicate that RA directly inhibits the erythroid differentiation program at the level of early adult HPC , and may lead to a shift from the erythroid to granulocytic differentiation pathway . Induction of phosphatidylinositol turnover and EGR - 1 mRNA expression by crosslinking of surface IgM and IgD in the human B cell line B104 . Here , we investigated the accumulation of cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) , the hydrolysis of inositol phosphates , protein kinase C ( PKC ) activity and the induction of Egr - 1 and c - fos mRNA expression by sIgM - and sIgD - crosslinking to examine differences in the signals mediated through sIgM and sIgD in B104 cells . Both sIgM - and sIgD - crosslinking with antibodies induced elevation of cAMP levels , phosphatidylinositol turnover , PKC activation and expression of Egr - 1 and c - fos mRNA , although sIgM - crosslinking was more effective than sIgD - crosslinking , presumably due to the higher expression of sIgM than of sIgD . Egr - 1 mRNA expression induced by sIgM - and sIgD - crosslinking was inhibited by H7 , erbstatin and genistein , but not by HA1004 . Erbstatin and genistein inhibited the sIg - crosslinking - induced Egr - 1 mRNA expression in a dose - dependent manner parallel to that observed in the inhibition of sIg - crosslinking - induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation . These findings suggest that the Egr - 1 mRNA activating signals through sIgM and sIgD are protein tyrosine kinase - and PKC - dependent , but protein kinase A - independent . Cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 rescued B104 cells from death induced by anti - IgM Ab , but did not affect the expression of Egr - 1 and c - fos mRNA , showing that CsA and FK506 affect signal transducers differently from or downstream to these molecules . The difference in signals transduced through sIgM and sIgD in B104 cells is discussed . Direct exposure to 2 , 3 , 7 , 8 - tetrachlorodibenzo - p - dioxin ( TCDD ) increases infectivity of human erythrocytes to a malarial parasite . Direct exposure to 10 nM 2 , 3 , 7 , 8 - TCDD caused a 75 % increase and a 2 - fold increase in the infectivity of isolated human erythrocytes to P . falciparum after 48 hours when the parasites were in an unsynchronized or synchronized state of growth , respectively . Co - treatment of RBCs with TCDD and NaOV completely blocked the TCDD - induced increase in parasitemia . Evidence for a trans - acting activator function regulating the expression of the human CD5 antigen . Interspecies somatic cell hybrids were generated by fusing the mouse T - lymphoma cell line , BW5147 , with normal human T lymphocytes at different stages of differentiation . Thymocytes , activated peripheral T lymphocytes , or an activated T - cell clone were used as human partners , respectively , in three independent fusions . Analysis at the phenotype and genetic level showed that lack of CD5 expression was due neither to segregation of human autosome 11 , on which the CD5 gene has been mapped , nor to deletion of the CD5 structural gene . Furthermore , loss of CD5 surface expression correlated with the absence of specific mRNA . Since these hybrids preferentially segregate human chromosomes , these results indicate the existence of a non - syntenic trans - active locus , or loci , positively controlling the expression of the human CD5 gene . Induction of the CD11b gene during activation of the monocytic cell line U937 requires a novel nuclear factor MS - 2 [ published erratum appears in J Immunol 1999 Jul 15 ; 163 ( 2 ) : 1091 ] The differentiation of myeloid precursors into mature myelomonocytic cells is characterized by the induction of the gene encoding the beta2 integrin CD11b . The transcription factors Sp1 and PU . 1 prime the CD11b promoter , but the nature of the factors responsible for its inducible expression are unknown . In addition to the CD11b gene , the homologous genes encoding CD11a and CD11c also exhibit inducible expression during myeloid differentiation . Therefore , we compared the nucleotide sequences of the CD11a , CD11b , and CD11c gene promoters to identify common elements that might contribute to inducible expression . This analysis identified one such element repeated four times within the CD11b promoter . Mutation of these elements indicated that two , MS - 2beta and MS - 2gamma , are critical to the induction of the CD11b gene during differentiation of the pro - monocytic cell line U937 . The molecular mass of these factors is approximately 28 kDa , and their DNA binding characteristics are indistinguishable from those of the novel nuclear factor MS - 2 . Taken together , our data indicate that MS - 2 mediates induction of the CD11b gene as cells of the monocytic lineage mature . We have investigated the effects of acetylsalicylic acid and sodium salicylate on the LPS - induced synthesis of the pro - coagulant protein tissue factor ( TF ) and the pro - inflammatory protein tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF - alpha ) , as well as the prostaglandin PGE2 in human monocytes . Both drugs dose - dependently inhibited LPS - induced TF and TNF - alpha synthesis at the mRNA and the protein level , and reduced PGE2 production . As evidenced by electro mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) and the use of a NF - kappa B prototypic probe , these drugs probably exert their inhibitory effects by interference with the nuclear translocation of NF - kappa B / c - Rel proteins . These data may expand the understanding of the anti - thrombotic and anti - inflammatory effects of these drugs when activation of monocytes occurs . The PML gene is fused to the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene ( RAR alpha ) in the acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) 15 ; 17 translocation . In the bone marrow , it is preferentially expressed in myeloid cells . PML appears to be transcriptionally regulated by class I and II interferons , which raises the possibility that interferons modulate the function and growth and differentiation potential of normal myeloid cells and precursors by activating PML - dependent pathways . Similarly , interferons could act on APL cells , alone or in combination with all - trans retinoic acid ( RA ) , especially if the PML / RAR alpha fusion transcript that results from the t ( 15 ; 17 ) is induced by interferon . We report here that PML is expressed at low levels or not expressed in normal circulating human monocytes , lymphocytes , and polymorphonucleate cells , but is markedly induced by interferon ; that PML and PML / RAR alpha expression is augmented by interferon in the NB4 APL cell line , which carries the t ( 15 ; 17 ) , and in APL blasts from patients ; that interferon inhibits growth and survival of NB4 APL cells in cooperation with RA ; that interferons alone have minimal maturation effect on NB4 cells ; and , finally , that interferon gamma , but not alpha or beta , induces maturation and growth suppression of NB4 cells with de novo retinoid resistance , and partially restores RA response . Effects of Ara - C on neutral sphingomyelinase and mitogen - and stress - activated protein kinases in T - lymphocyte cell lines . Neutral SMase activity was assessed in membranes from Jurkat , a human T - cell line , and EL4 , a murine T - cell line . Ara - C activated SMase with 10 minutes in both Jurkat and EL4 cells , while phorbol ester ( PMA ) had no effect . PMA , but not Ara - C or ceramides , activated ERK MAPKS , in Jurkat and EL4 . Thus , ceramide is not a positive signal for ERK activation in T - cell lines . The effects of Ara - C on JNK activity may be mediated through secondary response pathways . Comparative analysis identifies conserved tumor necrosis factor receptor - associated factor 3 binding sites in the human and simian Epstein - Barr virus oncogene LMP1 . Nonhuman primates are naturally infected with a B - lymphotropic herpesvirus closely related to Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) . These simian EBV share considerable genetic , biologic , and epidemiologic features with human EBV , including virus - induced tumorigenesis . However , latent , transformation - associated viral genes demonstrate marked sequence divergence among species despite the conserved functions . We have cloned the latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP1 ) homologs from the simian EBV naturally infecting baboons ( cercopithicine herpesvirus 12 , herpesvirus papio ) and rhesus monkeys ( cercopithicine herpesvirus 15 ) for a comparative study with the human EBV oncogene . Nevertheless , the simian EBV LMP1s retain most functions in common with EBV LMP1 , including the ability to induce NF - ( kappa ) B activity in human cells , to bind the tumor necrosis factor - associated factor 3 ( TRAF3 ) in vitro , and to induce expression of tumor necrosis factor - responsive genes , such as ICAM1 , in human B lymphocytes . Multiple TRAF3 binding sites containing a PXQXT / S core sequence can be identified in the simian EBV LMP1s by an in vitro binding assay . A PXQXT / S - containing sequence is also present in the cytoplasmic domain of the Hodgkin ' s disease marker , CD30 , and binds TRAF3 in vitro . The last 13 amino acids containing a PXQXT / S sequence are highly conserved in human and simian EBV LMP1 but do not bind TRAF3 , suggesting a distinct role for this conserved region of LMP1 . The conserved TRAF3 binding sites in LMP1 and the CD30 Hodgkin ' s disease marker provides further evidence that a TRAF3 - mediated signal transduction pathway may be important in malignant transformation . Chromosome 1 aneusomy with 1p36 under - representation is related to histologic grade , DNA aneuploidy , high c - erb B - 2 and loss of bcl - 2 expression in ductal breast carcinoma . Chromosome 1 abnormalities with loss of 1p36 have been investigated in 95 breast - cancer samples by means of a dual - target fluorescence in - situ hybridization ( FISH ) technique using the pUC 1 . 77 and p1 - 79 probes , specific for the 1q12 and 1p36 regions , respectively . Abnormalities for one or both probes were detected in 83 / 95 samples . Relative 1p36 under - representation was found in 79 / 95 . The clinical relevance of these alterations was studied by comparing the FISH results with several parameters currently used in breast - cancer pathology . Lobular or mucinous samples showed few or no alterations , whereas most ductal samples had high chromosome 1 polysomy with under - representation of 1p36 . In ductal carcinomas , chromosome 1 alterations increased with histologic grade , DNA aneuploidy , loss of bcl - 2 and high c - erb B - 2 expression . These associations were found to be statistically significant . No correlation between chromosome 1 alterations and nuclear grade , age , size , lymph - node involvement , hormonal receptor presence , proliferation activity or p53 protein expression was detected . G ( Anh ) MTetra , a natural bacterial cell wall breakdown product , induces interleukin - 1 beta and interleukin - 6 expression in human monocytes . A study of the molecular mechanisms involved in inflammatory cytokine expression [ published erratum appears in J Biol Chem 1994 Jun 17 ; 269 ( 24 ) : 16983 ] It is believed that induction of cytokine expression by bacterial cell wall components plays a role in the development and course of sepsis . However , most attention has been focused on lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . We studied the ability of N - acetylglucosaminyl - 1 , 6 - anhydro - N - acetylmuramyl - L - alanyl - D - isoglutamyl - m - diaminopimelyl - D - alanine ( G ( Anh ) MTetra ) , a naturally occurring breakdown product of peptidoglycan that is produced by soluble lytic transglycosylase of Escherichia coli , to induce cytokine expression in human monocytes . G ( Anh ) MTetra was found to strongly induce interleukin ( IL ) - 1 beta and IL - 6 mRNA expression after 2 h and IL - 1 beta and IL - 6 protein secretion after 48 h of activation . The increase in mRNA accumulation was at least partly due to an increase in the transcription rates of the respective genes and was accompanied by a strong induction of nuclear factor - kappa B and activator protein - 1 transcription factor expression . Experiments using inhibitors of protein kinase C , protein kinase A , and tyrosine kinase - dependent pathways revealed that G ( Anh ) MTetra - induced IL - 1 beta and IL - 6 mRNA expression involves activation of an H7 - inhibitable pathway . By using the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide , it was shown that G ( Anh ) MTetra - induced IL - 6 mRNA expression depends on the synthesis of new protein , whereas G ( Anh ) MTetra - induced IL - 1 beta mRNA accumulation does not . When responses to G ( Anh ) MTetra were compared with those to LPS and muramyldipeptide ( MDP ) , it was found that the optimal response to G ( Anh ) MTetra induction was similar to that of LPS but significantly higher than the response to MDP . Furthermore , maximal G ( Anh ) MTetra - induced IL - 1 beta and IL - 6 mRNA expression could be enhanced by co - stimulation with LPS or MDP , suggesting that different receptors and / or transduction pathways were involved . These results indicate that G ( Anh ) MTetra induces IL - 1 beta and IL - 6 expression in human monocytes suggesting a possible role for G ( Anh ) MTetra in the release of cytokines during sepsis . Previous studies have suggested that gangliosides have an important role in cell signaling and recognition . A mAb , R24 , that reacts specifically with a cell surface ganglioside ( GD3 ) has been demonstrated to stimulate proliferation of T cells derived from human peripheral blood . Additionally , IFN - gamma activity but not IL - 1 , IL - 2 , or IL - 4 activity was present in culture supernatants 72 h after R24 stimulation . In some donors , increased IL - 6 and TNF - alpha activity also was detected after R24 treatment . Furthermore , R24 treatment resulted in translocation of c - rel , but little or no NF kappa B p50 or p65 , from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and an increase of NF kappa B binding complexes containing c - rel and p50 . This treatment also caused increased tyrosine phosphorylation of specific protein substrates . These results suggest that multiple biochemical pathways are involved in the activation of human T cells by R24 . Genes encoding general initiation factors for RNA polymerase II transcription are dispersed in the human genome . General transcription factors are required for accurate initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II . Human cDNAs encoding subunits of these factors have been cloned and sequenced . This dispersed localization of a group of functionally related gene provides insights into the molecular mechanism of human genome evolution and their possible involvement in human diseases . BCL - 6 and the molecular pathogenesis of B - cell lymphoma . The results presented identify the first genetic lesion associated with DLCL , the most clinically relevant form of NHL . A more precise definition of the role of BCL - 6 in normal and neoplastic B - cell development is the goal of ongoing study of transgenic mice engineered either to express BCL - 6 under heterologous promoters or lacking BCL - 6 function due to targeted deletions . In addition to contributing to the understanding of DLCL pathogenesis , the identification of BCL - 6 lesions may have relevant clinical implications . The fact that BCL - 6 rearrangements identify biologically and clinically distinct subsets of DLCL suggests that these lesions may be useful as markers in selection of differential therapeutic strategies based on different risk groups . Furthermore , the BCL - 6 rearrangements can be used to identify and monitor the malignant clone with sensitive PCR - based techniques . Since clinical remission has been observed in a significant fraction of DLCL cases , these markers may serve as critical tools for sensitive monitoring of minimal residual disease and early diagnosis of relapse ( Gribben et al . 1993 ) . Pancreatic development and maturation of the islet B cell . Studies of pluripotent islet cultures . Pancreas organogenesis is a highly regulated process , in which two anlage evaginate from the primitive gut . They later fuse , and , under the influence of the surrounding mesenchyme , the mature organ develops , being mainly composed of ductal , exocrine and endocrine compartments . Early buds are characterized by a branching morphogenesis of the ductal epithelium from which endocrine and exocrine precursor cells bud to eventually form the two other compartments . The three compartments are thought to be of common endodermal origin ; in contrast to earlier hypotheses , which suggested that the endocrine compartment was of neuroectodermal origin . During recent years , studies of insulin - gene regulation and , in particular , the tissue - specific transcriptional control of insulin - gene activity have provided information on pancreas development in general . The present review summarizes these findings , with a special focus on our own studies on pluripotent endocrine cultures of rat pancreas . Previous analyses of immunoglobulin V region promoters has led to the discovery of a common octamer motif which is functionally important in the tissue - specific and developmentally regulated transcriptional activation of immunoglobulin genes . The germline promoters ( Ko ) located upstream of the J region gene segments of the kappa locus also contain an octamer motif ( containing a single base pair mutation and referred to as the variant octamer ) which has been shown previously to bind Oct - 1 and Oct - 2 transcription factors in vitro . We find that , although the variant octamer motif binds Oct - 1 and Oct - 2 in vitro with 5 - fold lower affinity than the consensus octamer motif , mutation of the variant octamer motif to either a consensus octamer or non - octamer motif has no effect on transcriptional activation from the germline promoter . We also find significant differences in activation of germline and V region promoters by kappa enhancers . Our results suggest that the germline promoters and V region promoters differ in their dependence on octamer for activation and respond differently to enhancer activation . These findings have important implications in regulation of germline transcription as well as concomitant activation of the V - J recombination of the kappa light chain locus . Generation of CD1 + RelB + dendritic cells and tartrate - resistant acid phosphatase - positive osteoclast - like multinucleated giant cells from human monocytes . We previously showed that granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) and macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( M - CSF ) stimulate the differentiation of human monocytes into two phenotypically distinct types of macrophages . However , in vivo , not only CSF but also many other cytokines are produced under various conditions . Those cytokines may modulate the differentiation of monocytes by CSFs . However , the monocyte - derived DC were not terminally differentiated cells ; they could still convert to macrophages in response to M - CSF . Tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF - alpha ) stimulated the terminal differentiation of the DC by downregulating the expression of the M - CSF receptor , cfms mRNA , and aborting the potential to convert to macrophages . In contrast to IL - 4 , interferon - gamma ( IFN - gamma ) had no demonstrable effect on the differentiation of monocytes . Rather , IFN - gamma antagonized the effect of IL - 4 and suppressed the DC and MGC formation induced by GM - CSF + IL - 4 and M - CSF + IL - 4 , respectively . Taken together , these results provide a new aspect to our knowledge of monocyte differentiation and provide evidence that human monocytes are flexible in their differentiation potential and are precursors not only of macrophages but also of CD1 + relB + DC and TRAP - positive MGC . Such a diverse pathway of monocyte differentiation may constitute one of the basic mechanisms of immune regulation . The NF - kappa B inhibitor , tepoxalin , suppresses surface expression of the cell adhesion molecules CD62E , CD11b / CD18 and CD106 . Tepoxalin , a dual enzyme inhibitor of cyclooxygenase and 5 - lipoxygenase has been shown to inhibit T - cell activation . Its immunosuppressive property is distinct from cyclosporin because only tepoxalin , but not cyclosporin , suppresses NF - kappa B activation . Here we report that tepoxalin selectively inhibits intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 ( ICAM - 1 , CD54 ) / MAC - 1 ( CD11b / CD18 ) dependent adhesion of polymorphonuclear cells to IL - 1 activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells . Expression of other adhesion molecules such as lymphocyte function associated - antigen - 1 ( CD11a / CD18 ) and CD54 were unaffected . Our results suggest that by inhibiting NF - kappa B activation , surface expression of several adhesion molecules can be modulated and that tepoxalin may be useful in treating selected adhesion mediated events such as leukocyte migration or atherosclerotic plaque formation . J393 / CD43 was found to be hyposialylated , bearing predominantly O - linked monosaccharide glycans , whereas G10 - 2 / CD43 bore complex sialylated tetra - and hexasaccharide chains . Treatment with soluble , bivalent mAb J393 killed 25 - 50 % of the cell population , while concomitant engagement of either the CD3 . TcR complex or the integrins CD18 and CD29 significantly potentiated this effect . Treatment of Jurkat cells with mAb J393 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of specific protein substrates that underwent hyperphosphorylation upon antigen receptor costimulation . Signal transduction through tyrosine kinase activation may lead to altered gene expression , as J393 / CD43 ligation prompted decreases in the nuclear localization of the transcriptional regulatory protein NF - kappaB and proteins binding the interferon - inducible regulatory element . Since peripheral blood T - lymphocytes express cryptic epitopes for mAb J393 , these findings demonstrate the existence of a tightly regulated CD43 - mediated pathway for inducing apoptosis in human T - cell lineages . Sterol dependent LDL - receptor gene transcription in lymphocytes from normal and CML patients . Sterol regulatory element ( SRE ) has been recognized to regulate various key genes coding for especially low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) - receptor , 3 - hydroxy - 3 - methylglutaryl coenzyme A ( HMG - CoA ) reductase and HMG - CoA synthase known to play a crucial role in the cholesterol feedback mechanism . The deranged cholesterol feedback mechanism has been widely recognised in initiation as well as progression of various types of cancers including chronic myeloid leukaemia ( CML ) . However , this factor appeared when the CML patients achieved complete haematological remission ( CHR ) through alpha - interferon therapy . Further , an inverse relationship was also observed between sterol modulated LDL - receptor gene transcription and the binding affinity of this 47 kDa factor to the SRE sequence . Based upon these results we propose that alpha - interferon through its receptor initiates phosphatidic acid dependent signalling which in turn regulates the affinity of 47 kDa sterol regulatory element binding factor as well as LDL - receptor gene transcription in lymphocytes from CML patients . Multiple prolactin - responsive elements mediate G1 and S phase expression of the interferon regulatory factor - 1 gene . The interferon regulatory factor - 1 ( IRF - 1 ) gene is both an immediate - early G1 phase gene and an S phase gene inducible by PRL in rat Nb2 T lymphocytes . Upon transfection into Nb2 T cells , 1 . 7 kilobases ( kb ) of IRF - 1 5 ' - flanking DNA linked to a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) reporter gene mediated a 30 - fold induction of CAT enzyme activity in response to 24 h of PRL stimulation . Deletion mutants containing 1 . 3 , 0 . 6 , and 0 . 2 kb 5 ' - flanking DNA were incrementally less transcriptionally active , although 0 . 2 kb still mediated a 12 - fold induction by PRL . The sequence between - 1 . 7 and - 0 . 2 kb linked to a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter failed to respond to PRL stimulation , suggesting that the activity of upstream PRL response elements may require an interaction with promoter - proximal elements . By assaying CAT enzyme activity across a 24 - h PRL induction time course , we were able to assign G1 vs . S phase PRL responses of the IRF - 1 gene to different regions of the IRF - 1 5 ' - flanking and promoter DNA . The 0 . 2 - kb IRF - CAT construct was induced by PRL stimulation during the G1 phase of the cell cycle . In contrast , the 1 . 7 - kb IRF - CAT construct was inducible by PRL during both G1 and S phase of the cell cycle . Regulation of the BZLF1 promoter of Epstein - Barr virus by second messengers in anti - immunoglobulin - treated B cells . Initiation of the Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) lytic cycle is dependent on the transcription of the BZLF1 gene . The BZLF1 gene promoter ( Zp ) was activated by crosslinking of cell surface immunoglobulin ( Ig ) with anti - Ig antibody in B cells , even in the absence of other viral genes . We identified several anti - Ig response elements within Zp , which were originally defined as 12 - O - tetradecanoylphorbol - 13 - acetate ( TPA ) response elements ( ZI repeats and ZII , an AP - 1 - like domain ) . Since anti - Ig crosslinking leads to activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) and an increase in intracellular calcium level , Zp was tested for the response to these cellular factors . Treatment with calcium ionophore A23187 increased Zp activity . When the calcium ionophore was used in conjunction with TPA , a PKC activator , the Zp induction was synergistically enhanced . 1 - ( 5 - Isoquinolinyl sulfonyl ) - 2 - methylpiperazine , an inhibitor of PKC , inhibited the anti - Ig inducibility of Zp . Calmodulin antagonists , compound R24571 and trifluoperazine , blocked the Zp activation with anti - Ig . These findings suggest that Zp responds directly to changes in the activity of both PKC and calcium / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase . Requirement of tyrosine kinase activation for the anti - Ig - mediated Zp activation was also demonstrated through the use of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin . These cellular gene regulatory molecules induced with anti - Ig may cooperatively play an important part in achieving efficient EBV activation as seen with anti - Ig treatment in B cells . SCL protein production was examined in a variety of hemopoietic cell lines by immunoblotting using specific polyclonal antisera . SCL protein was detected in erythroid , megakaryocyte , mast and early myeloid cell lines , as well as in several lymphoid leukemia cell lines which are known to harbor SCL gene rearrangements . This size discrepancy appeared to be due to cell - specific translational regulation , since overexpression of a retrovirally transfected SCL gene yielded the higher molecular weight forms in most cell lines ( GP + E - 86 , AT2 . 5 , M1 ) but only the 22 kDa form in the myeloid cell line , WEHI - 3B / D + . Overexpression of full - length SCL protein in the lymphoid cell lines , SupT1 and Raji , did not alter cell phenotype and there was no evidence for autoregulation of SCL transcription . In addition , the present results indicate that SCL protein size was determined by regulation of translation in a cell - specific manner . Description and functional implications of a novel mutation in the sex - determining gene SRY . The sex - determining gene SRY was screened for molecular alteration in an XY sex - reversed female by single - strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) technique . An A - to - G transition was detected which leads to an exchange of a tyrosine by a cysteine in the SRY protein . The affected tyrosine residue located at the C terminus of the DNA binding protein is evolutionarily strongly conserved among the members of the HMG box containing proteins . Using gel shift assay and peptide synthesis such a mutation is shown to abolish the SRY protein DNA binding ability . The involvement of this particular amino acid in the binding specificity is also discussed . Induction of tyrosine phosphorylation and T - cell activation by vanadate peroxide , an inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases . Rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of key cellular proteins is a crucial event in the transduction of activation signals to T - lymphocytes . The regulatory role of protein tyrosine phosphatases ( PTPases ) in this process was explored by studying the effects of a powerful PTPase inhibitor , vanadate peroxide ( pervanadate ) , on the activation cascade of Jurkat human leukaemic T - cells . Pervanadate induced activation of the tyrosine kinases lck and fyn ( 4 - and 3 - fold respectively ) and a dramatic increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins , notably phospholipase C gamma 1 . After this event , we observed a rise in intracellular Ca2 + concentration , corresponding to an influx . In the CD45 - negative variant , the effect of pervanadate on tyrosine phosphorylation was globally decreased and some phosphorylated substrates were specifically missing . Pervanadate also stimulated transcription of the c - fos gene and accumulation of its mRNA as well as several other hallmarks of T - lymphocyte activation such as surface expression of the CD69 antigen and the interleukin 2 receptor alpha - chain ( CD25 ) . Pervanadate synergized with signals delivered by T - cell antigen receptor engagement or by a phorbol ester to induce interleukin 2 production . We thus conclude that PTPases play a crucial role in the negative regulation of signal transduction culminating in T - lymphocyte activation . Moreover , induction of tyrosine phosphorylation appears sufficient per se to initiate a complete activation programme . Activation of nuclear factor - kappaB via T cell receptor requires a Raf kinase and Ca2 + influx . Functional synergy between Raf and calcineurin . Treatment of T cells with the protein kinase C activator PMA in combination with Ca2 + ionophores mimics this process , and the two agents are often substituted for TCR stimulation , bypassing the TCR . TCR signaling was triggered by treating Jurkat T cells with PHA or anti - CD3 Abs , and NF - kappaB activation was monitored by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and / or by kappaB - dependent reporter assays . Contrary to the idea that protein kinase C is involved in TCR - mediated activation of NF - kappaB , high doses of staurosporine did not interfere with activation of NF - kappaB by PHA , while the same dose of staurosporine completely blocked activation by PMA . PHA - induced kappaB - dependent reporter activity was , however , effectively blocked by a dominant negative form of Raf - 1 , suggesting a critical role for a Raf kinase . The TCR - mediated activation of NF - kappaB was also dependent on a Ca2 + influx , because the Ca2 + channel blocker , SK & F 96365 , as well as other agents that prevented the Ca2 + influx , inhibited NF - kappaB activation . Cotransfection of a constitutively active form of calcineurin largely substituted for the Ca2 + requirement and reversed the blockade by SK & F 96365 . Consistent with these observations , coexpression of constitutively active forms of Raf - 1 and calcineurin synergistically induced kappaB - dependent reporter activity , suggesting a physiologically relevant functional interaction between the kinase and the phosphatase . Synergistic interactions between overlapping binding sites for the serum response factor and ELK - 1 proteins mediate both basal enhancement and phorbol ester responsiveness of primate cytomegalovirus major immediate - early promoters in monocyte and T - lymphocyte cell types . Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) infection is nonpermissive or persistent in many lymphoid and myeloid cell types but can be activated in differentiated macrophages . Two multicopy basal enhancer motifs within the SCMV MIE enhancer , namely , 11 copies of the 16 - bp cyclic AMP response element ( CRE ) and 3 copies of novel 17 - bp serum response factor ( SRF ) binding sites referred to as the SNE ( SRF / NFkappaB - like element ) , as well as four classical NFkappaB sites within the HCMV version , contribute to TPA responsiveness in transient assays in monocyte and T - cell types . The SCMV SNE sites contain potential overlapping core recognition binding motifs for SRF , Rel / NFkappaB , ETS , and YY1 class transcription factors but fail to respond to either serum or tumor necrosis factor alpha . Unlike classical NFkappaB sites , neither the SNE nor the SEE motif responded to phosphatase inhibition by okadaic acid . However , the TPA responsiveness of both CMV elements proved to involve synergistic interactions between the core SRF binding site ( CCATATATGG ) and the adjacent inverted ETS binding motifs ( TTCC ) , which correlated directly with formation of a bound tripartite complex containing both the cellular SRF and ELK - 1 proteins . This protein complex was more abundant in U - 937 , K - 562 , and HeLa cell extracts than in Raji , HF , BALB / c 3T3 , or HL - 60 cells , but the binding activity was altered only twofold after TPA treatment . A 40 - fold stimulation of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity mediated by four tandem repeats of the SNE could be induced within 2 h ( and up to 250 - fold within 6 h ) after addition of TPA in DNA - transfected U - 937 cells , indicating that the stimulation appeared likely to be a true protein kinase C - mediated signal transduction event rather than a differentiation response . Slight differences in the sequence of the core SRF binding site compared with that of the classical c - Fos promoter serum response element , together with differences in the spacing between the SRF and ETS motifs , appear to account for the inability of the SCMV SNEs to respond to serum induction . The TAL - 1 gene specifies for a basic domain - helix - loop - helix protein , which is involved in the control of normal hematopoiesis . In human pathology , the TAL - 1 gene product is expressed in a high percentage of T - cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias in the pediatric age range ; however , it has not been established whether the expression has a causal role in oncogenesis . In this report , we describe the phenotype of mouse transgenic lines obtained by inducing tal - 1 protein expression in lymphoid tissues using the LCK promoter . Histopathological analysis revealed lymphomas of T - cell type , often comprising a minor B - cell component . Some mice showed marked splenic lymphocyte depletion . Primary lymphocyte cultures showed partial independence from exogenous growth stimuli and increased resistance to low - serum apoptosis . These data indicate that TAL - 1 , expressed in T cells , is per se a potent oncogene , which may exert a key leukemogenetic role in the majority of T - cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias . Tissue and cell - type specific expression of the tuberous sclerosis gene , TSC2 , in human tissues . By using a partial nucleotide sequence from the cloned TSC2 and polymerase chain reaction methodology , we constructed a digoxigenin - labeled complementary DNA probe to examine TSC2 gene expression in autopsy - or biopsy - derived human tissues by in situ hybridization . It was prominently and selectively ( within the central nervous system ) expressed in pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex and other motor neurons , e . g . , in spinal cord and brainstem nuclei . Visceral TSC2 expression was comparable in autopsy tissues from patients with and without TSC ; TSC2 messenger RNA expression was most prominent in cells with a rapid mitotic rate and turnover , e . g . , epithelia and lymphocytes , with central nervous system pyramidal cells and other neurons being an obvious exception , and / or in cells with important secretory / transport functions . This widespread expression of the TSC2 gene supports the view that it encodes a protein vital to cell growth and metabolism or one that functions as a tumor / growth suppressor . Apoptosis signaling pathways in normal T cells : differential activity of Bcl - 2 and IL - 1beta - converting enzyme family protease inhibitors on glucocorticoid - and Fas - mediated cytotoxicity . Restimulation of T cell blasts up - regulates Fas and Fas ligand expression , with subsequent interaction leading to cell death . Overexpression of Bcl - 2 in tumor cells blocks apoptosis induced by many stimuli , but inhibition of Fas - mediated killing has not been consistently observed . To examine the behavior of Bcl - 2 in normal cells , T cell blasts were transiently transfected with Bcl - 2 and related gene products to determine the effect on apoptotic signaling . Transient overexpression of Bcl - 2 in mouse and human T cell blasts did not block Fas - mediated apoptosis , whereas etoposide - and glucocorticoid - induced cytotoxicity was potently inhibited . Expression of Bcl - xL and adenovirus E1B 19K did not interfere with anti - Fas killing . Since T cells normally express Bcl - 2 and Bcl - xL following activation , their inability to block Fas - mediated apoptosis may allow for the elimination of self - reactive cells and the appropriate regulation of immune responses . Increased interleukin 2 transcription in murine lymphocytes by ciprofloxacin . The fluoroquinolone antibiotic , ciprofloxacin ( cipro ) , induces hyperproduction of interleukin 2 ( IL - 2 ) and interferon - gamma ( IFN - gamma ) in stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes . In this investigation an enhanced and prolonged IL - 2 and IL - 2 mRNA response was also detected in both stimulated ( T cell mitogens or alloantigens ) murine splenocytes and in the stimulated murine T cell line EL - 4 in the presence of ciprofloxacin ( 5 - 80 micrograms / ml ) as compared to control cells without antibiotics . EL - 4 cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the IL - 2 promoter and enhancer region linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter gene . Analysis of CAT activity revealed that cipro enhanced IL - 2 gene induction . In addition , EL - 4 cells incubated with ciprofloxacin showed an early peak and more activated nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT - 1 ) as compared to control cells without antibiotics . Taken together , cipro inhibited IFN - gamma synthesis , but enhanced IL - 2 production in murine lymphocytes by means of influencing NFAT - 1 and causing an increased IL - 2 transcription . Human T - cell leukemia virus type I Tax associates with and is negatively regulated by the NF - kappa B2 p100 gene product : implications for viral latency . Human T - cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV - I ) is the etiologic agent of the adult T - cell leukemia , an aggressive and often fatal malignancy of activated human CD4 T cells . HTLV - I encodes an essential 40 - kDa protein termed Tax that not only transactivates the long terminal repeat of this retrovirus but also induces an array of cellular genes . Tax - mediated transformation of T cells likely involves the deregulated expression of various cellular genes that normally regulate lymphocyte growth produced by altered activity of various endogenous host transcription factors . In particular , Tax is capable of modulating the expression or activity of various host transcription factors , including members of the NF - kappa B / Rel and CREB / ATF families , as well as the cellular factors HEB - 1 and p67SRF . In this study , we demonstrate that HTLV - I Tax can physically associate with p100 , the product of the Rel - related NF - kappa B2 gene , both in transfected cells and in HTLV - I - infected leukemic T - cell lines . In contrast , a mutant of Tax that selectively fails to activate nuclear NF - kappa B expression does not associate with p100 . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) Rhabdomyosarcomas do not contain mutations in the DNA binding domains of myogenic transcription factors . Skeletal myogenesis is regulated by a group of transcription factors ( MyoD , myogenin , myf5 , and myf6 ) that are ` ` basic helix - loop - helix ' ' proteins that bind to the promoters of muscle - specific genes and promote their expression . We have previously shown that after a mutation of Leu122 to Arg the DNA binding basic domain of MyoD confers c - myc - like functional characteristics to the protein . In this study we used single - strand conformation polymorphism analysis to determine whether such mutations occur naturally in rhabdomyosarcomas . We have found that the basic domains of all the myogenic factors remain unaltered in rhabdomyosarcomas . Function and activation of NF - kappa B in the immune system . NF - kappa B is a ubiquitous transcription factor . Nevertheless , its properties seem to be most extensively exploited in cells of the immune system . Among these properties are NF - kappa B ' s rapid posttranslational activation in response to many pathogenic signals , its direct participation in cytoplasmic / nuclear signaling , and its potency to activate transcription of a great variety of genes encoding immunologically relevant proteins . The activity of DNA binding NF - kappa B dimers is tightly controlled by accessory proteins called I kappa B subunits of which there are also five different species currently known in vertebrates . I kappa B proteins inhibit DNA binding and prevent nuclear uptake of NF - kappa B complexes . An exception is the Bcl - 3 protein which in addition can function as a transcription activating subunit in th nucleus . They involve phosphorylation and proteolytic reactions and seem to be controlled by the cells ' redox status . Interference with the activation or activity of NF - kappa B may be beneficial in suppressing toxic / septic shock , graft - vs - host reactions , acute inflammatory reactions , acute phase response , and radiation damage . The inhibition of NF - kappa B activation by antioxidants and specific protease inhibitors may provide a pharmacological basis for interfering with these acute processes . Lack of T - cell - mediated recognition of the fusion region of the pml / RAR - alpha hybrid protein by lymphocytes of acute promyelocytic leukemia patients . The in vitro immunization of peripheral blood lymphocytes from four patients in remission ( S . R . , F . R . , M . M . , P . G . ) with BCR1 / 25 , a 25 - mer pml / RAR - alpha , did not elicit either a polyclonal or a clonal immune response specific to the peptide . We then generated new donor anti - pml / RAR - alpha CD4 ( + ) T - cell clones . One clone ( C3 / 5 , CD3 ( + ) , CD4 ( + ) , CD8 ( - ) ) was selected for further analysis . Clone C3 / 5 showed specific proliferation , cytotoxicity , and cytokine ( tumor necrosis factor alpha , granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ) production when challenged with autologous lymphoblastic cell lines pulsed with peptide BCR1 / 25 . C3 / 5 cells developed specific proliferation and cytotoxicity when challenged with peptide - pulsed lymphoblastic cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes from the four DR11 ( + ) APL patients . Incubation of APL cells with IFN - gamma failed to induce HLA class II molecules and recognition by the C3 / 5 clone . Since APL cells do not express HLA class II molecules , we tested in two donors ( D . E . and C . H . R . ) and in patients S . R . and P . G . whether the use of 9 - mer peptides ( BCR1 / 9 ) would generate a CD8 / HLA class I - restricted response . These findings are discussed in relation to possible therapeutic approaches to the immunotherapy of APL . The proximal regulatory element of the interferon - gamma promoter mediates selective expression in T cells . Within the region between - 108 and - 40 base pairs of the IFN - gamma promoter are two conserved and essential regulatory elements , which confer activation - specific expression in T cells . This report describes studies indicating that the most proximal of these two regulatory elements is an important determinant of its restricted expression . Jun is essential for activation - induced transcription and binds preferably as a heterodimer with ATF - 2 . In contrast , CREB appears to dampen transcription from this element . The CpG dinucleotide in this element is selectively methylated in Th2 T cells and other cells that do not express IFN - gamma , and methylation markedly reduces transcription factor binding . As a target for DNA methylation and for binding of transcription factors that mediate or impede transcription , this element appears to play a central role in controlling IFN - gamma expression . CD40 , but not lipopolysaccharide and anti - IgM stimulation of primary B lymphocytes , leads to a persistent nuclear accumulation of RelB . In this study we analyzed the effect of CD40 stimulation on the activity and nuclear appearance of Rel / nuclear factor kappaB ( NF - kappaB ) factors in primary murine B lymphocytes . We show that triggering of CD40 signaling pathway ( s ) by CD40 ligands expressed on L cells led to strong activation of an NF - kappaB - controlled beta - globin reporter gene in primary B lymphocytes from transgenic mice . Analyses of nuclear translocation of individual members of Rel proteins after CD40 induction of primary B cells showed a strong and long - lasting accumulation of RelB and , less pronounced , of c - Rel . LPS stimulation did not give rise to a persistent nuclear accumulation of RelB and c - Rel , whereas nuclear c - Rel , but not RelB , accumulated after B cell receptor stimulation . CD40 induced not only nuclear translocation but also de novo synthesis of RelB RNA and protein . In S107 cells stably transfected with relB genes , stimulation of nuclear RelB translocation by CD40 was observed . These results indicate that stimulation of CD40 signaling pathways exerts a long - lasting stimulatory effect on both the transcription and nuclear translocation of RelB . Since LPS and anti - IgM were unable to activate RelB , CD40 appears to trigger a special program of gene expression involved in the proliferation and / or differentiation of B lymphocytes . Identification and characterization of a leukocyte - specific component of the nuclear body . The NB is also a target of antibodies in the serum of patients with the autoimmune disease primary biliary cirrhosis . In this study , serum from a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis was used to identify a cDNA encoding a novel component of the NB , a 140 - kDa protein designated Sp140 . The carboxyl portion of Sp140 contained a zinc - finger domain and a bromodomain , motifs that are present in proteins regulating gene transcription . High levels of Sp140 mRNA were detected in human spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes , but not other human tissues . The level of SP140 mRNA in myeloid precursor cell lines HL60 and NB4 markedly increased in response to chemically induced cellular differentiation . Immunohistochemical techniques were used to demonstrate that SP140 localized to the NB in differentiated HL60 and NB4 cells . The location of Sp140 in the NB , and expression of this gene in cells involved in host defense , suggest that Sp140 may be involved in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia and viral infection . Regulation of cytokine and cytokine receptor expression by glucocorticoids . Glucocorticoids ( GCS ) profoundly inhibit several aspects of T cell immunity largely through inhibition of cytokine expression at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels . GCS were also reported to act indirectly by inducing transforming growth factor - beta expression , which in turn blocks T cell immunity . In exerting their antiproliferative effects , GCS diffuse into target cells where they bind their cytoplasmic receptor , which in turn translocates to the nucleus where it inhibits transcription of cytokine genes through direct binding to the glucocorticoid response elements ( GRE ) , which are located in the promoter region of cytokine genes or , alternatively , through antagonism of the action of transcription factors required for optimal transcriptional activation . In contrast to their inhibitory effects on cytokine expression , GCS up - regulate cytokine receptor expression that correlates with enhanced cytokine effects on target cells . In this review , we summarize the current state of knowledge of the mechanism of action of GCS , including the phenomenon of steroid - induced rebound , which ensues upon GCS withdrawal . Isolation and characterization of murine fra - 1 : induction mediated by CD40 and surface Ig is protein kinase C dependent . The murine fra - 1 gene , encoding Fos - related Ag 1 , was isolated from a splenic cDNA library and sequenced . Murine fra - 1 was highly homologous to rat and human fra - 1 . Oligonucleotide primers based on the murine sequence were used to construct a quantitative reverse transcription - PCR assay for gene expression . This contrasts with induction of c - fos by both CD40 and sIg , which is PKC independent and indicates that CD40 is capable of signaling through PKC or a closely related kinase . CD40 - mediated fra - 1 induction did require tyrosine kinase activity . These results demonstrate that CD40 , like sIg , may employ PKC in producing select outcomes , that individual B cell receptors may signal downstream events via both PKC - dependent and PKC - independent pathways , and that multiple signal transduction pathways may be used to activate the expression of closely related genes . Pharmacological modification of cytokine dysregulation , therefore , has been suggested as a therapeutic modality for HIV - 1 infection . Dr . Dezube of Beth Israel Hospital ( Boston ) concisely reviews the state of our knowledge regarding the effects of pentoxifylline on expression of tumor necrosis factor - alpha , a cytokine known to influence HIV - 1 replication and to play a possible role in the clinical manifestations of advanced infection with this virus . Results of preliminary studies , many of which were conducted by Dr . Dezube , suggest that use of this agent in combination with antiretroviral compounds may prove useful in the treatment of patients with HIV - 1 infection . Activation of the granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor promoter in T cells requires cooperative binding of Elf - 1 and AP - 1 transcription factors . The granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) gene has been studied extensively as a model system of transcriptional induction during T - lymphocyte activation . The GM - CSF gene is not expressed in resting peripheral blood T cells but is rapidly induced at the transcriptional level following activation through the cell surface T - cell receptor . A highly conserved 19 - bp element located immediately 5 ' of the human GM - CSF TATA box ( bp - 34 to - 52 ) , herein called purine box 1 ( PB1 ) , has been shown to bind a T - cell nuclear protein complex and to be required for transcriptional induction of the GM - CSF gene following T - cell activation . The PB1 sequence motif is highly conserved in both human and murine GM - CSF genes . In this report , we demonstrate that the PB1 element alone confers inducibility on a heterologous promoter following transfection into human Jurkat T cells . In addition , we identify a major PB1 nuclear protein - binding complex that is not present in resting peripheral blood T cells but is rapidly induced following T - cell activation . Sequence analysis revealed that PB1 is composed of adjacent binding sites for Ets and AP - 1 transcription factors . In vitro mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that both the Ets and AP - 1 sites are required for binding of the inducible PB1 nuclear protein complex and for the transcriptional activity of this element and the GM - CSF promoter in activated T cells . Steroid - resistant asthma . Cellular mechanisms contributing to inadequate response to glucocorticoid therapy . The current study examined whether alterations in glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) binding contribute to poor response to glucocorticoid therapy in asthma . 29 asthma patients with forced expiratory volume in 1 s ( FEV1 ) < 70 % predicted were studied . Patients were classified as steroid sensitive ( SS ) if their morning FEV1 increased > 30 % after a 1 - wk course of oral prednisone 20 mg twice daily and steroid resistant ( SR ) if they failed to increase > 15 % . PBMC obtained from these two groups , 17 SR and 12 SS , as well as 12 normal controls were analyzed . SR patients had two distinguishable GR binding abnormalities : 15 of the 17 SR patients demonstrated a significantly reduced GR binding affinity , as compared with SS patients ( P = 0 . 0001 ) and normal controls ( P = 0 . 0001 ) . This defect was localized to T cells and reverted to normal after 48 h in culture media . However , incubation with a combination of IL - 2 and IL - 4 sustained this abnormality . Furthermore , GR number failed to normalize after incubation in media alone or IL - 2 and IL - 4 . Therefore , SR asthma may be due to more than one abnormality , the majority related to a reversible cytokine - induced reduction in GR binding affinity and the second related to an irreversible reduction in GR number . These findings may have important implications for the design of alternative treatment approaches for recalcitrant asthma . Prevalence of aneuploidy , overexpressed ER , and overexpressed EGFR in random breast aspirates of women at high and low risk for breast cancer . Breast tissue biomarkers which accurately predict breast cancer development within a 10 year period in high risk women are needed but currently not available . We initiated this study to determine 1 ) the prevalence of one or more breast tissue abnormalities in a group of women at high risk for breast cancer , and 2 ) if the prevalence of biomarker abnormalities is greater in high risk than in low risk women . Eligible high risk women were those with a first degree relative with breast cancer , prior breast cancer , or precancerous mastopathy . Low risk women were those without these or other major identifiable risk factors . Ductal cells were obtained via random fine needle aspirations and cytologically classified . Biomarkers included DNA ploidy , estrogen receptor ( ER ) , and epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . The prevalence of DNA aneuploidy was 30 % , overexpression of ER 10 % , and overexpression of EGFR 35 % , in the 206 high risk women whose median 10 year Gail risk ( projected probability ) of developing breast cancer was 4 . 5 % . The prevalence of aneuploidy and overexpressed EGFR was significantly higher in the high risk women than in the 25 low risk controls ( p < 0 . 002 ) , whose median 10 year Gail risk was 0 . 7 % . The difference in the prevalence of ER overexpression between high and low risk groups was not statistically significant ( p = 0 . 095 ) . A significant difference was noted in the prevalence of one or more abnormal biomarkers between the high risk and low risk women ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B subunit p65 mRNA accumulation in lipopolysaccharide - stimulated human monocytic cells treated with sodium salicylate . Lipopolysaccharide is one of the most potent trigger substances for monocytes and macrophages causing secretion of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin - 1 . The nature of the nuclear factors involved in regulation of these cytokine genes is still unknown . Nuclear factor kappa B ( NF - kappa B ; heterodimer of p50 and p65 ) proteins have been suggested to play an important role in gene transcription of inflammatory mediators when monocytes are stimulated with lipopolysaccharide . Nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs such as salicylates have been used to treat symptoms of inflammation , and a new mechanism of drug action was suggested recently . Salicylates have been shown to inhibit lipopolysaccharide - induced gene transcription via inhibition of NF - kappa B activation by preventing the degradation of NF - kappa B inhibitor ` ` I kappa B ` ` , blocking the translocation of NF - kappa B into the nuclear compartment . However , the nature of the subunit involved in this mechanism has not been defined . To examine the mechanisms by which salicylates affect cytokine gene transcription , the amount of active and inactive NF - kappa B and NF - kappa B mRNA , in Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide - stimulated human monocytic cells was assessed . High doses of sodium salicylate suppressed NF - kappa B p65 mRNA accumulation , resulting in suppression of total NF - kappa B , p50 on tissue oligonucleotide had no effects on lipopolysaccharide - induced NF - kappa B activation . The data demonstrate that the p65 subunit of NF - kappa B is inhibited by salicylate treatment and highlight the role of salicylate in the control of gene expression of inflammatory mediators . Glucocorticoid - mediated inhibition of RANTES expression in human T lymphocytes . The chemokine RANTES has been implicated in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammatory diseases including asthma and rhinitis which are frequently treated with glucocorticoids . We observed that dexamethasone dramatically inhibited RANTES mRNA expression dose dependently in anti - CD3 activated Hut - 78 T cells and human PBMCs . The down - regulation of RANTES expression by glucocorticoids in T cells may directly contribute to the efficacy of these agents in suppressing cellular infiltration and to their anti - inflammatory properties . We now show that in EBV - transformed B lymphocytes most of TRAF1 or TRAF3 and 5 % of TRAF2 are associated with LMP1 and that most of LMP1 is associated with TRAF1 or TRAF3 . Further deletional and alanine mutagenesis analyses and comparison with TRAF binding sequences in CD40 , in CD30 , and in the LMP1 of other lymphycryptoviruses provide the first evidence that PXQXT / S is a core TRAF binding motif . The negative effects of point mutations in the LMP1 ( 1 - 231 ) core TRAF binding motif on TRAF binding and NF - kappaB activation genetically link the TRAFs to LMP1 ( 1 - 231 ) - mediated NF - kappaB activation . TRAF3 is a negative modulator of LMP1 ( 1 - 231 ) - mediated NF - kappaB activation . Surprisingly , TRAF1 , - 2 , or - 3 does not interact with the terminal LMP1 CT aa 333 to 386 which can independently mediate NF - kappaB activation . The constitutive association of TRAFs with LMP1 through the aa 187 to 231 domain which is important in NF - kappaB activation and primary B - lymphocyte growth transformation implicates TRAF aggregation in LMP1 signaling . Lack of IL - 12 signaling in human allergen - specific Th2 cells . IL - 12 is a powerful skewer of CD4 + T cell responses toward the Th1 phenotype by inducing IFN - gamma production in naive Th cells . In the present study we addressed the question of whether IL - 12 can reverse established Th2 responses into Th1 / Th0 responses by inducing IFN - gamma production in memory Th2 cells . To this aim , allergen - specific CD4 + T cell clones ( TCC ) were generated from the peripheral blood of three atopic patients , and their cytokine profiles were analyzed . The majority of these TCC exhibited a strongly polarized Th2 cytokine profile , and the production of IFN - gamma could not be induced by exogenous IL - 12 . Only those TCC with low IFN - gamma levels in the absence of IL - 12 responded to IL - 12 by additional enhancement of IFN - gamma production . The IL - 12 nonresponsiveness of the Th2 clones was further evident by the total lack of IL - 12 - induced phosphorylation of STAT4 ( signal transducer and activator of transcription - 4 ) , a transcription factor that is typically involved in IL - 12 signaling . Consequently , IL - 12 also failed to induce the DNA - binding activity of STAT4 - containing complexes in the nuclei of these Th2 clones . All TCC expressed equal levels of the low - affinity IL - 12R beta1 subunit . Our results indicate that human allergen - specific Th cells with strongly polarized Th2 cytokine profiles do not respond to IL - 12 and , therefore , can not be induced to produce IFN - gamma . The apparent high frequency of IL - 12 - nonresponsive Th cells within the allergen - specific populations in atopic patients predicts a limited skewing potential of IL - 12 in the case of established Th2 responses , but only affecting newly recruited naive Th cells . Cloning and expression of the Epstein - Barr virus - encoded dUTPase : patients with acute , reactivated or chronic virus infection develop antibodies against the enzyme . The active enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli and in insect cells as a non - fusion protein . The protein from E . coli specifically converted dUTP to dUMP and did not react with other dNTPs or NTPs . MAbs against the dUTPase reacted with a protein of approximately 31 kDa in 12 - O - tetradecanoyl - phorbol - 13 - acetate ( TPA ) - stimulated B cells harbouring either type 1 or type 2 EBV . The protein was found in untreated cells at low levels , whereas induction of the lytic replication cycle by TPA treatment or by providing the immediate early transactivator BZLF1 in trans resulted in increased expression . We demonstrated that the virus dUTPase isolated from EBV - infected cells is a phosphoprotein . The protein expressed in insect cells was used to test for the presence of specific antibodies in sera from normal , healthy carriers and from patients with various diseases . While the sera of EBV - negative individuals ( 0 / 3 ) or healthy carriers ( 0 / 33 ) did not contain detectable levels of antibodies , patients with mononucleosis ( 5 / 18 ) , chronic EBV infection ( 2 / 7 ) , EBV reactivation ( 7 / 20 ) and human immunodeficiency virus infection ( 5 / 24 ) showed elevated antibody titres against the enzyme . The enzyme might therefore be a potential target for drug therapy under conditions of active DNA replication . The catalytic domain of pp56 ( lck ) , but not its regulatory domain , is sufficient for inducing IL - 2 production . The lymphoid src kinase pp56 ( lck ) has been shown to be essential for the induction of different T lymphocyte responses , including CD4 - mediated enhancement of Ag - induced T cell activation , early T cell differentiation , induction of IL - 2 production , and cytotoxicity . It is assumed that pp56 ( lck ) acts on these processes by phosphorylating substrates . However , it has been recently reported that the NH2 regulatory domain is sufficient to mediate CD4 accessory function . In this report we address the contribution of the regulatory and catalytic domains of pp56 ( lck ) to another function of this enzyme independent of CD4 : TCR - induced IL - 2 production . Only the catalytic , but not the NH2 regulatory , domain of pp56 ( lck ) was able to induce NF - AT region transactivation on its own and to cooperate with other intracellular signals to trigger this response . Moreover , the catalytic domain of pp56 ( lck ) was able to induce IL - 2 cytokine production to an extent similar to that of wild - type pp56 ( lck ) . We conclude that different domains of the pp56 ( lck ) molecule contribute to regulate distinct biologic functions . In fact , while the NH2 regulatory domain is sufficient to mediate CD4 accessory function , we show here that the catalytic domain of pp56 ( lck ) is sufficient for induction of IL - 2 production , mimicking TCR ligation . [ The changes in glucocorticoid receptors in peripheral leukocytes in asthmatic subjects ] The number of glucocorticoid receptors ( GCR ) in peripheral leukocytes was determined by radioligand - binding assay in extrinsic and intrinsic asthmatics . Their corresponding plasma cortisol levels were assessed . Besides , there was also a linear correlation between the number of GCR and the age of the initial attack of asthma . No difference in plasma cortisol level was found between asthmatics and healthy subjects . The decrease of the number of GCR in asthmatics , we think , is related to heredity and repeated attacks of asthma . Novel aldosterone receptors : specificity - conferring mechanism at the level of the cell membrane . Functional studies in extra - renal , nonepithelial cells such as smooth muscle cells and more recently circulating human lymphocytes have provided increasing evidence that aldosterone produces not only classical genomic effects , but also rapid non - genomic effects on transmembrane electrolyte movements . These involve activation of the sodium / proton - exchanger of the cell membrane at very low , physiological concentrations of aldosterone with an acute onset within 1 - 2 minutes . A second messenger cascade involved is the inositol - 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate / calcium pathway which responds over the same rapid time course . Such changes clearly can not be explained by genomic mechanisms , which are responsible for later effects than the membrane - related rapid responses . In addition to its rapid time course the unique characteristics of this new pathway for steroid action include a 10000 - fold selectivity for aldosterone over cortisol and the ineffectiveness of spironolactones , classical mineralocorticoid antagonists , as antagonists of the response . SDS - PAGE analysis of the receptor protein has shown a molecular weight of approximately 50 kD . The present paper reviews the data supporting a new , two - step model for non - genomic and genomic aldosterone effects . It also suggests a novel specificity - conferring mechanism for mineralocorticoid action at the membrane level . The macrophage transcription factor PU . 1 directs tissue - specific expression of the macrophage colony - stimulating factor receptor . In order to further understand the transcription factors which play a role in the commitment of multipotential progenitors to the monocyte / macrophage lineage , we have initiated an investigation of the factors which activate the M - CSF receptor very early during the monocyte differentiation process . Here we demonstrate that the human monocytic M - CSF receptor promoter directs reporter gene activity in a tissue - specific fashion . Since one of the few transcription factors which have been implicated in the regulation of monocyte genes is the macrophage - and B - cell - specific PU . 1 transcription factor , we investigated whether PU . 1 binds and activates the M - CSF receptor promoter . Here we demonstrate that both in vitro - translated PU . 1 and PU . 1 from nuclear extracts bind to a specific site in the M - CSF receptor promoter just upstream from the major transcription initiation site . Mutations in this site which eliminate PU . 1 binding decrease M - CSF receptor promoter activity significantly in macrophage cell lines only . Furthermore , PU . 1 transactivates the M - CSF receptor promoter in nonmacrophage cells . These results suggest that PU . 1 plays a major role in macrophage gene regulation and development by directing the expression of a receptor for a key macrophage growth factor . Increased natural killer cell activity correlates with low or negative expression of the HER - 2 / neu oncogene in patients with breast cancer . BACKGROUND . Increased expression of the HER - 2 / neu oncogene in breast cancer correlates with decreased estrogen receptor concentration and seems to be an important prognostic factor . The authors investigated whether there is a correlation between HER - 2 / neu expression and immunologic parameters representing tumor defense in patients with breast cancer . METHOD . A Western blot analysis was used to investigate HER - 2 / neu expression , whereas a chromium - release assay using the K562 cell line as target was used to measure natural killer ( NK ) cell activity . RESULTS . In patients with breast cancer , NK cell activity was significantly higher compared with patients with benign tumors ( P = 0 . 006 ) or healthy control subjects ( P = 0 . 002 ) . Moreover , 23 . 3 % of patients with breast cancer showed an overexpression of HER - 2 / neu protein . Within this group of patients , NK cell activity was significantly lower ( 45 . 6 + / - 16 . 1 % ) compared with the group with no HER - 2 / neu overexpression ( 57 . 3 + / - 11 . 0 % ) . NK cell activity did not increase in patients with HER - 2 / neu overexpression . Thus , there was a statistically significant correlation of cytolytic effector cell function with HER - 2 / neu expression of the tumor ( P = 0 . 003 ) , and HER - 2 / neu overexpression correlated with a negative estrogen receptor status ( P = 0 . 005 ) . These data add further evidence to previous observations from the authors ' laboratory that certain tumor characteristics may be associated with reactions of the host with breast cancer . [ The value of the clinical test of glucocorticoid receptors of peripheral blood leukocytes in patients with chronic pulmonary heart disease ] In order to inquire into the functional state of adrenal cortex in patients with pulmonary heart disease , the number of glucocorticoid receptors ( GCR ) of peripheral blood leukocytes in patients with chronic pulmonary heart disease was determined with radioligand - binding assay and the corresponding plasma cortisol levels were assessed with radioimmune assays . The results showed that the number of GCR in the patients was significantly reduced ( P < 0 . 01 ) and it was increased when their health state was improved . However , it was still lower than that in healthy subjects ( P < 0 . 01 ) . The number of GCR in the patients was greatly increased when these patients were treated with oxygen ( P < 0 . 01 ) . No difference in plasma cortisol was found between the patients and the healthy subjects ( P > 0 . 05 ) . These results indicate that the function of adrenal cortex may be improved by the compensation mechanism of the patients , but the lower GCR number was the result of lacking of oxygen in the patients . Therefore oxygen therapy is helpful in raising the activity of glucocorticoid receptors and controlling the development of the disease . Both IL - 2 and IL - 4 bind to receptors containing the common gamma chain and JAK3 . Although JAK3 is required for proper lymphoid development , the precise roles of this kinase in IL - 2 and IL - 4 signaling in lymphocytes have not been defined . Here , we have studied IL - 2 and IL - 4 signaling in B cell lines lacking JAK3 . Although IL - 2 - induced phosphorylation of IL - 2R beta , JAK1 , and STAT5 all required the presence of JAK3 , IL - 4 - mediated phosphorylation of JAK1 , STAT6 , and insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 did not . These data indicate that IL - 4 signaling occurs in the absence of of JAK3 , but is comparatively inefficient . These findings may help in understanding the pathogenesis of the immunodeficiency that occurs with mutations of JAK3 and may suggest a mechanism for the pleiotropic effects of IL - 4 . Elf - 1 and Stat5 bind to a critical element in a new enhancer of the human interleukin - 2 receptor alpha gene [ published erratum appears in Mol Cell Biol 1997 Apr ; 17 ( 4 ) : 2351 ] The interleukin 2 receptor alpha - chain ( IL - 2R alpha ) gene is a key regulator of lymphocyte proliferation . IL - 2R alpha is rapidly and potently induced in T cells in response to mitogenic stimuli . transcription , thereby amplifying expression of its own high - affinity receptor . IL - 2R alpha transcription is at least in part controlled by two positive regulatory regions , PRRI and PRRII . PRRI is an inducible proximal enhancer , located between nucleotides - 276 and - 244 , which contains NF - kappaB and SRE / CArG motifs . PRRII is a T - cell - specific enhancer , located between nucleotides - 137 and - 64 , which binds the T - cell - specific Ets protein Elf - 1 and HMG - I ( Y ) proteins . However , none of these proximal regions account for the induction of IL - 2R alpha transcription by IL - 2 . To find new regulatory regions of the IL - 2R alpha gene , 8 . 5 kb of the 5 ' end noncoding sequence of the IL - 2R alpha gene have been sequenced . This putative human IL - 2rE , designated PRRIII , confers IL - 2 responsiveness on a heterologous promoter . PRRIII contains a Stat protein binding site that overlaps with an EBS motif ( GASd / EBSd ) . These are essential for IL - 2 inducibility of PRRIII / CAT reporter constructs . IL - 2 induced the binding of Stat5a and b proteins to the human GASd element . To confirm the physiological relevance of these findings , we carried out in vivo footprinting experiments which showed that stimulation of IL - 2R alpha expression correlated with occupancy of the GASd element . Our data demonstrate a major role of the GASd / EBSd element in IL - 2R alpha regulation and suggest that the T - cell - specific Elf - 1 factor can serve as a transcriptional repressor . Signal transduction by DR3 , a death domain - containing receptor related to TNFR - 1 and CD95 . Expression of DR3 appears to be restricted to tissues enriched in lymphocytes . DR3 signal transduction is mediated by a complex of intracellular signaling molecules including TRADD , TRAF2 , FADD , and FLICE . Thus , DR3 likely plays a role in regulating lymphocyte homeostasis . The Rel / NF - kappa B proteins , p50 , p52 , p65 , c - Rel , and RelB , constitute a family of transcription factors involved in the positive regulation of a variety of genes during the immune response . Recently , it has been shown that RelB knockout mice have no dendritic cells ( DC ) . An overexpression of p50 has been described in follicular dendritic cells ( FDC ) . A constitutive NF - kappa B activity has been reported in mature macrophages . This led to the hypothesis that some of the Rel / NF - kappa B proteins were key nuclear factors in functions of accessory cells of the immune response . Therefore , we investigated in situ the nuclear localization of Rel / NF - kappa B proteins in accessory cells of the immune system by immunohistochemistry and double labeling by immunofluorescence from five normal human tonsils and five lymph nodes with follicular hyperplasia . Nuclear p65 and c - Rel proteins were found in all cell types including lymphocytes . In germinal centers GC , p50 , p52 , and RelB were found in the nuclei of FDC only and were not detected in the nuclei of CD68 + cells . In T cell areas , p50 , p52 , and RelB were found in the nuclei of HLA - DR + cells with an antigen - presenting cell ( APC ) morphology . p52 and RelB were detected in the nuclei in both CD1a + and CD68 + cells from the T cell area , whereas p50 was found only in CD68 - and CD1a - cells . Cells with nuclear p50 were negative for the CD38 , CD20 and CD2 markers . These results show that , physiologically , high levels of nuclear of p50 , p52 and RelB are restricted to accessory cells of the immune system , which include FDC in GC , and DC and macrophages in the T cell zone , that specialized scavenger macrophages from GC do not have detectable levels of p52 and RelB , whereas macrophages from the T cell area , known to present the antigen to T cells , do have both nuclear p52 and RelB , and that in the T cell zone , p52 and RelB are located in nuclei of both CD1a + , CD68 + or both , cells APC , whereas p50 is restricted to CD1a - and CD68 - APC . Tyrosines 113 , 128 , and 145 of SLP - 76 are required for optimal augmentation of NFAT promoter activity . SLP - 76 ( SH2 domain leukocyte protein of 76 kDa ) is a recently identified substrate of the TCR - stimulated protein tyrosine kinases that functions in the signal transduction cascade linking the TCR with IL - 2 gene expression . In this report , we demonstrate that engagement of the TCR results in tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP - 76 in its amino - terminal acidic region . Two tyrosines ( Y113 and Y128 ) fall within an identical five amino - acid motif and are shown to be phosphorylated upon TCR ligation . A third tyrosine within the amino - terminal region ( Y145 ) appears to be the most important for optimal SLP - 76 function , as altering it alone to phenylalanine has a potent impact on SLP - 76 augmentation of NFAT promoter activity . Human interferon regulatory factor 2 gene . Intron - exon organization and functional analysis of 5 ' - flanking region . Interferon regulatory factor 2 ( IRF - 2 ) is a transcriptional regulatory protein that terminates interferon beta expression initiated by interferon regulatory factor 1 . In this study , we isolated the genomic DNA for human IRF - 2 gene , determined the intron - exon structure of the human IRF - 2 gene , mapped the major transcription initiation site , identified a number of potential regulatory elements in the 5 ' - flanking region , and localized the IRF - 2 gene on human chromosome 4 . The region which induced these inductions was identified as being confined to 40 nucleotides 5 ' to the major transcriptional initiation site by testing a series of clones with truncated promoter of IRF - 2 . This region contains elements which are shared with the transcriptional enhancers of other genes including interferon regulatory factor 1 , interferon beta , and interferon - inducible genes . These data suggest that interferon regulatory factor 1 not only triggers the activation of the interferon signal transduction pathway , but also may play a role in limiting the duration of this response by activating the transcription of IRF - 2 . The human myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen ( MNDA ) is expressed constitutively in cells of the myeloid lineage , appearing in myeloblast cells in some cases of acute myeloid leukemia and consistently being detected in promyelocyte stage cells as well as in all later stage cells including peripheral blood monocytes and granulocytes . The human myeloid leukemia cell lines , HL - 60 , U937 , and THP - 1 , express similar levels of immunochemically detectable MNDA . The effect of interferon alpha on the MNDA mRNA is also observed in the cell lines HL - 60 , U937 , and THP - 1 . The MNDA mRNA level in primary granulocytes was unaffected by addition of interferon alpha and other agents including interferon gamma , endotoxin , poly ( I ) . poly ( C ) , and FMLP . The MNDA mRNA level in the myeloid cell lines was also unaffected by the latter four agents . Induction of differentiation in the myeloid cell lines with phorbol ester induces monocyte differentiation which was accompanied by a decrease in MNDA mRNA level . The effects of phorbol ester on MNDA mRNA appeared to be associated with induced differentiation since inhibiting cell proliferation did not alter the level of MNDA mRNA and cell cycle variation in MNDA mRNA levels were not observed . The ability of interferon alpha to up - regulate MNDA mRNA in phorbol ester treated myeloid cell lines is consistent with the observations made in primary monocytes . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) Involvement of transcription factor YB - 1 in human T - cell lymphotropic virus type I basal gene expression . Sequences which control basal human T - cell lymphotropic virus type I ( HTLV - I ) transcription likely play an important role in initiation and maintenance of virus replication . We previously identified and analyzed a 45 - nucleotide sequence ( downstream regulatory element 1 [ DRE 1 ] ) , + 195 to + 240 , at the boundary of the R / U5 region of the long terminal repeat which is required for HTLV - I basal transcription . An affinity column fraction , containing p37 , stimulated HTLV - I transcription approximately 12 - fold in vitro . We now report the identification of a cDNA clone ( 15B - 7 ) , from a Jurkat expression library , that binds specifically to the DRE 1 regulatory sequence . In vitro transcription and translation of 15B - 7 cDNA produced a fusion protein which bound specifically to the HTLV - I + 195 to + 240 oligonucleotide . The partial cDNA encodes a protein which is homologous to the C - terminal 196 amino acids of the 36 - kDa transcription factor , YB - 1 . On the basis of the molecular weight , DNA - binding characteristics , and in vivo transactivation activity , we suggest that the previously identified DRE 1 - binding protein , p37 , is YB - 1 . Changes in triiodothyronine ( T3 ) mononuclear leukocyte receptor kinetics after T3 administration and multiple cold - air exposures . Repeated cold - air exposures increase human triiodothyronine ( T3 ) plasma clearance rates . To study the response of the nuclear T3 receptor ( NT3R ) in this condition , binding characteristics were analyzed in human mononuclear leukocytes ( MNL ) . In addition , we supplemented one group of individuals with a daily oral replacement dose of T3 to isolate the influence of serum thyroxine ( T4 ) and thyrotropin ( TSH ) levels on receptor kinetics . The T3 - subjects received placebo [ n = 8 ] and the T3 + subjects received T3 ( 30 micrograms / d ) [ n = 8 ] in a double - blind fashion . Mononuclear leukocytes were isolated from peripheral blood before the cold exposure and drug regimen began , and then after every 20 exposures . The dissociation constant ( Kd ) and maximum binding capacity ( MBC ) of the NT3R values were log transformed to minimize between - subject variability . In the T3 + group , serum total thyroxine ( TT4 ) , free T4 ( FT4 ) , and TSH were approx 50 % lower than both basal and T3 - values . The log10Kd increased 0 . 304 + / - 0 . 139 ( p < 0 . 04 ) and the log10MBC increased 0 . 49 + / - 0 . 10 ( p < 0 . 001 ) in the T3 + subjects compared to baseline . This change in MBC represents a 311 % increase in the MBC over baseline and a fivefold increase over placebo - treated subjects . The T3 - group showed no change in MBC over the study . CD40 - stimulated human B lymphocytes are highly permissive to a productive infection by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 . Transient expression assays with plasmids containing deleted parts of the LTR region linked to a reporter gene showed that the NF - kappaB binding site was essential for HIV - 1 LTR activity in CD40 - stimulated B lymphocytes . In addition , electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays revealed that important NF - kappaB binding activity composed of at least p50 , p65 , and c - Rel NF - kappaB subunits was present in nuclei of CD40 - stimulated B cells . These results confirm at a molecular level the ability of HIV - 1 to replicate in B cells and that this activity is strongly associated with NF - kappaB . Sequence analysis and expression in cultured lymphocytes of the human FOSB gene ( G0S3 ) . G0S3 is a member of a set of putative G0 / G1 switch regulatory genes ( G0S genes ) selected by screening cDNA libraries prepared from human blood mononuclear cells cultured for 2 hr with lectin and cycloheximide . The sequence shows high homology with the murine FOSB gene , which encodes a component of the AP1 transcriptional regulator . Comparison of cDNA and genomic sequences reveals a 4 - exon structure characteristic of the FOS family of genes . Freshly isolated cells show high levels of FOSB / G0S3 and FOS / G0S7 mRNAs , which decline rapidly during incubation in culture medium . The kinetics of expression suggest that the high initial levels are caused by the isolation procedure , and do not reflect constitutive expression . In cells preincubated for a day , levels of FOS mRNA reach a maximum 20 min after the addition of lectin and decline to control levels over the next 3 hr . Levels of FOSB mRNA reach a maximum 40 min after the addition of lectin and decline to control levels over the next 6 hr . In freshly isolated cells , both FOS and FOSB mRNAs increase dramatically in response to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide . These differences in expression of FOS and FOSB suggest different roles and regulation . These indicate where base order has been adapted for purposes other than stem - loop stability ( e . g . , encoding proteins or gene regulation ) . Regions of low potential in a 68 . 5 - kb genomic segment containing the FOSB gene suggest that the potential may help locate genes in uncharted DNA sequences . Susceptibility to natural killer cells and down regulation of MHC class I expression in adenovirus 12 transformed cells are regulated by different E1A domains . All human adenoviruses transform rodent cells in vitro , but only cells transformed by serotypes belonging to subgroups A ( Ad12 ) and B ( Ad3 ) are tumorigenic for immunocompetent animals . In these cells , the expression of MHC - class I antigens is repressed and might allow them to escape from recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ) and to develop in tumor . Furthermore , these cell lines appear resistant to lysis by natural killer ( NK ) cells . To determine the E1A domain ( s ) responsible for these properties several cell lines were created by transforming baby rat kidney ( BRK ) cells with a set of plasmids expressing different Ad2 / Ad12 hybrid E1A gene products . The MHC class 1 gene expression was inhibited in cells expressing the Ad12 13S mRNA product and in cells transformed with Ad2 / Ad12 hybrid E1A gene product harboring the C - terminal part of the conserved region ( CR ) 3 of Ad12 . The results obtained suggest that two Ad12 E1A domains are required to induce resistance of the cell lines to NK cells . Bruton ' s agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase ( Btk ) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase involved in the human disease X - linked agammaglobulinemia ( XLA ) . The gene is expressed in all hematopoietic cells with the exception of T - cells and plasma cells . For this expression pattern the first 280 bp upstream of the major transcriptional start site seems to be sufficient . The transcription factor Spi - 1 / PU . 1 as well as the closely related factor Spi - B bound to the PU - box in B - cells . In the erythroleukemia cell line K562 , due to the absence of Spi - B , only PU . 1 bound to the Btk promoter . Mutation of either site reduced the expression in transient transfection experiments . However , mutation of the PU box had no effect in the T - cell line Jurkat , where none of the Spi - 1 family members is expressed . In fetal liver of PU . 1 - / - mice , which lack lymphoid and myeloid cells , expression of Btk was reduced two - to threefold but not abolished . Collectively this study shows that expression of the Btk gene is regulated by the combined action of Sp1 - and PU . 1 - family members . T cell response to Epstein - Barr virus transactivators in chronic rheumatoid arthritis . Rheumatoid arthritis is a multistep disorder associated with autoimmune features of yet unknown etiology . Implication of viruses such as Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) in rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis has been suspected on the basis of several indirect observations , but thus far , a direct link between EBV and rheumatoid arthritis has not been provided . Here we show that a large fraction of T cells infiltrating affected joints from a patient with chronic rheumatoid arthritis recognizes two EBV transactivators ( BZLF1 and BMLF1 ) in a major histocompatibility complex - restricted fashion . Responses to these EBV antigens by synovial lymphocytes from several other chronic rheumatoid arthritis patients were readily detectable . Thus these results suggest a direct contribution of EBV to chronic rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis . Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induces expression of inflammatory cytokines in monocytes / macrophages via CD14 , one of the LPS receptors , which is expressed predominantly in these cells . It has been demonstrated that Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS ( P - LPS ) also is able to induce inflammatory cytokines in human gingival fibroblasts . Therefore , it is important to determine whether CD14 is expressed in gingival fibroblasts and to define the P - LPS - mediated signal - transducing mechanism in the cells . P - LPS - induced expression of the monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ( MCP - 1 ) gene in the cells was inhibited markedly by treatment with anti - human CD14 antibody and was completely inhibited by herbimycin A , a potent inhibitor of tyrosine kinase . Furthermore , P - LPS - induced expression of the MCP - 1 gene in the cells also was blocked by inhibitors of two transcription factors , i . e . , curcumin , an inhibitor of AP - 1 , and pyrolidine dithiocarbamate , an inhibitor of NF - kappaB . Both inhibitors inhibited monocyte chemotactic activity in the culture supernatant of P - LPS - treated cells . Gel shift mobility assay showed stimulation of the AP - 1 and NF - kappaB contents in P - LPS - treated cells . This study is the first to demonstrate the expression of CD14 in human gingival fibroblasts and to show that the signal - transducing pathway of P - LPS in the cells is mediated by CD14 . rel Is rapidly tyrosine - phosphorylated following granulocyte - colony stimulating factor treatment of human neutrophils . Stimulation of neutrophils with granulocyte - colony stimulating factor ( G - CSF ) results in an enhanced respiratory burst , prolonged survival , and increased tumor cell killing . The effects of G - CSF are mediated by binding to specific , high affinity receptors . G - CSF receptors lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity , but activation of the receptor results in the rapid induction of tyrosine kinase activity . Antiphosphotyrosine immunoblots of whole cell lysates prepared from neutrophils show that the G - CSF rapidly induces prominent tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein of a relative molecular mass of 80 kDa . Using monospecific antibodies , the 80 - kDa tyrosine - phosphorylated protein has been shown to be p80c - rel , a proto - oncogene belonging to a family of transcriptional regulators which include NF - kB . The induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of p80c - rel was unique to G - CSF in that granulocyte - macrophage colony stimulating factor which also stimulates neutrophils and induces tyrosine phosphorylation does not result in tyrosine phosphorylation of p80c - rel . The consequences of p80c - rel tyrosine phosphorylation are not yet known ; however , tyrosine - phosphorylated p80c - rel is capable of binding to DNA , and G - CSF stimulation results in an increase in the amount of p80c - rel which binds to DNA . These results demonstrate that one of the first biochemical events which occurs in neutrophils following G - CSF stimulation , activation of a tyrosine kinase , leads directly to the tyrosine phosphorylation of p80c - rel . Patterns of Pan expression and role of Pan proteins in endocrine cell type - specific complex formation . The Pan gene encodes at least two distinct transcripts , Pan - 1 and Pan - 2 ( also known as E47 and E12 , respectively ) , by the mechanism of alternative RNA splicing . Northern blot analyses performed on rat and mouse tissues have detected ubiquitously expressed Pan transcripts , but the abundance , distribution , and form of Pan proteins have not been clearly defined . Studies of cell lines representing endocrine , fibroblast , and lymphoid lineages using polyclonal antisera to detect E2A proteins have suggested that significant E2A protein expression is restricted to B - lymphocytes . We have developed a monoclonal antibody , Yae , which is specific for Pan / E2A proteins , and have used the Yae antibody to examine a variety of endocrine and nonendocrine cell lineages for differences in Pan / E2A protein expression , subcellular localization , and heteromeric complex formation . In contrast to previous results obtained using polyclonal antiseras to detect Pan / E2A proteins , we report comparable levels of Pan proteins in GH / PRL - and insulin - producing , B - and T - lymphocyte cells . IEF - 1 , a pancreatic beta - cell type - specific complex believed to regulate insulin expression , is demonstrated to consist of at least two distinct species , one of which does not contain Pan molecules . Although it has been postulated that pituitary endocrine cells and pancreatic endocrine beta - cells share identical Pan / E2A complexes , native - Western analyses of pituitary and endocrine beta - cells detect Pan proteins in distinct cell type - specific complexes . Visualization of the endogenous NF - kappa B p50 subunit in the nucleus of follicular dendritic cells in germinal centers . NF - kappa B , a 50 kDa / 65 kDa ( p50 / p65 ) heterodimer , is a ubiquitous transcription factor involved in the positive regulation of various immune genes . The aim of this study was to determine whether NF - kappa B is related to a particular cell type and / or differentiation step during immunopoiesis . Using in situ hybridization on sections from non HIV hyperplastic lymph nodes , we found that the gene of the 105 kDa precursor of p50 was overexpressed in the light zone of germinal centers , with a network aspect , which suggested the involvement of follicular dendritic cells ( FDC ) . By immunohistochemistry , p50 protein was detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus of FDC , confirming the involvement of FDC . Furthermore , p50 protein was detected in the cytoplasm of all lymphocytes . Nuclei of lymphocytes from FDC clusters were negative . We next studied p65 and c - Rel protein expression in FDC clusters . p65 was detected in the cytoplasm of FDC , whereas nuclei were negative . Furthermore , p65 was detected in the nuclei of some lymphocytes . c - Rel protein was detected only in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes and not in the nucleus and cytoplasm of FDC . Our results indicated that , in the context of T cell - dependent B cell immunopoiesis occurring in FDC clusters , p50 is mainly related to FDC with a massive overexpression in the nuclei , whereas p65 is expressed in a scattered manner in the nuclei of lymphocytes and c - Rel protein exclusively in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes from FDC clusters . These results suggested that the two subunits of NF - kappa B and the c - Rel protein have different roles in different cell types during B cell immunopoiesis . Cloning and characterization of NF - ATc and NF - ATp : the cytoplasmic components of NF - AT . Present evidence indicates a pathway of signal transmission in T cells that is outlined in figure 1 . The elevation in intracellular calcium that is induced by interactions at the antigen receptor leads to the activation of the calcium - dependent phosphatase calcineurin . This in turn leads to the nuclear association of the cytosolic component of NF - ATc . The activation of calcineurin and the nuclear import of NF - ATc can both be blocked by cyclosporin A or FK506 in complex with their respective immunophilins . Once in the nucleus , NF - ATc interacts with NF - ATn to form an active transcriptional complex . NF - ATn is a ubiquitous protein , can be synthesized in response to PMA , and has many similarities to AP - 1 . The mechanism by which NF - ATc enters the nucleus is unknown , and although it appears to require calcineurin , NF - ATc has not yet been shown to be an in vivo substrate of calcineurin . Alternative mechanisms include the possibility that NF - ATc operates on some cytoplasmic anchor or that other proteins that are controlled by calcineurin carry out the nuclear import of NF - ATc . Although NF - ATp copurifies with NF - ATc , there is as yet no understanding of how NF - ATp is functioning in vivo . Induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 by low - density lipoprotein . Low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) is a well - established risk factor for atherosclerosis . When endothelial cells are incubated with this lipoprotein in pathophysiologic amounts , the cells are activated . Among the documented cellular responses to LDL is increased recruitment of monocytes , which are believed to play a major role in promoting intimal plaque formation . The findings presented here link an atheogenic lipoprotein , LDL , with the induction of an adhesion molecule important in atherogenesis Human LDL induces the vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( VCAM - 1 ) transcriptionally with an increase in mRNA levels through activation of the VCAM promoter . After a 2 - day incubation in LDL , the binding of NF - kappa B , which is believed to be a key oxidative - stress sensor for VCAM regulation , remains at basal level . In contrast , the binding activities of AP - 1 and GATA , on the other hand , are increased by LDL . Thus , a component of LDL - enhanced endothelial recruitment of monocytes is attributed to VCAM - 1 expression , which appears to be mediated through AP - 1 and GATA . These data identify LDL as a VCAM - inducer possibly distinct from cytokines and endotoxin . Involvement of nuclear factor - kappa B activation in IgE synthesis in human B cells . Nuclear factor - kappa B ( NF - kappa B ) is a transcription factor that binds to the consensus DNA sequence in the cis - acting elements of various genes . Although NF - kappa B activates the expression of many genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses , little is known about the role of NF - kappa B activation in the induction of IgE synthesis in human B cells . Therefore we first examined the participation of NF - kappa B in germline C epsilon transcription in a human Burkitt lymphoma B cell line , DND39 . Stimulation of DND39 cells with IL - 4 or anti - CD40 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) activated phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase and subsequently induced nuclear expression of NF - kappa B , which was identified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays . n - Acetyl - L - cysteine ( NAC ) , a potent antioxidant , blocked NF - kappa B activation caused by IL - 4 and by anti - CD40 mAb . Although inhibition of IL - 4 - driven germline C epsilon transcription by NAC was not sufficient , the agent remarkably diminished anti - CD40 mAb - mediated up - regulation of germline C epsilon transcription . Second , we studied the effect of NAC on IgE synthesis in human normal B cells costimulated with IL - 4 and anti - CD40 mAb . NAC was effective in inhibiting mature C epsilon transcription and IgE synthesis in the T cell - independent culture system . However , NAC did not significantly affect the spontaneous production of IgE by atopic B cells . These results indicate that NF - kappa B activity is commonly inducible in DND39 cells by IL - 4 and anti - CD40 mAb and suggest that NF - kappa B sensitive to NAC may play a role in regulating IgE synthesis in B cells . Prostaglandin E2 induction of binding activity to CRE and AP - 2 elements in human T lymphocytes . Prostaglandins of the E series are immunomodulatory agents which exert inhibitory as well as stimulatory effects on a variety of immune responses . Since it is known that PGE2 is able to increase cAMP levels , we investigated whether it can affect gene expression through the activation of the transcription factors which bind enhancer elements in the promoter regions of cAMP - regulated genes . Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay , we demonstrated that a short treatment of human T lymphocytes with PGE2 induces specific binding activity to CRE and AP - 2 , but not AP - 1 , DNA elements . Since the okadaic acid , a potent protein phosphatase inhibitor , prolongs the induction of the binding activity , phosphorylation events are likely to occur . More interestingly , transfection experiments with CRE - CAT plasmide show that PGE2 activates the transcription of a CRE - containing promoter . Nasal NK - and T - cell lymphomas share the same type of Epstein - Barr virus latency as nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Hodgkin ' s disease . Nasal T / NK - cell lymphomas can be further separated into those of natural killer ( NK ) cell lineage or of T - cell lineage , with differences in cellular phenotype , T - cell receptor ( TcR ) gene rearrangement and TcR transcript expression . Both NK - and T - cell subtypes are closely associated with Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) . In this study , EBV gene expression was determined in 23 cases of nasal lymphoma ( NL ) by in situ hybridisation ( ISH ) , reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) and immunohistochemistry ( IH ) . Of the 23 cases , 19 were classified as NK - cell and 4 as T - cell tumours . ISH for EBV - encoded small non - polyadenylated RNAs showed that all cases , whether NK or T , harboured EBV in virtually all tumour cells . RT - PCR demonstrated that NL of both subtypes expressed EBNAI of the QUK splice pattern , the latent membrane proteins , LMP1 and 2 and the BamHI A rightward transcripts in the absence of EBNA2 mRNAs , compatible with the latency type II pattern . Although 2 early lytic transcripts , BZLF1 and BHRF1 , were also detected in 13 and 10 cases , respectively , the lack of ZEBRA staining in any case indicates that these lytic transcripts are most likely expressed by rare cells in the biopsies entering lytic cycle . The viral transcriptional pattern similar to that of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Hodgkin ' s disease suggests that EBV can exploit common regulatory mechanisms for gene transcription in diverse host cell types . Down - regulation of immunogenic proteins ( EBNA2 - EBNA6 ) in nasal lymphoma may enable tumour cells to evade host cytotoxic T - cell surveillance . Potent gene regulatory and antiproliferative activities of 20 - methyl analogues of 1 , 25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 . The biological active form of vitamin D3 , 1 , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( VD ) , regulates cellular growth and differentiation . This provides the hormone with an interesting therapeutic potential . However , hypercalcemia is a side effect , which is caused by VD ' s classical action , the regulation of calcium homeostasis . In this report the biological properties of the compounds ZK161422 and ZK157202 , which are 20 - methyl - and 20 - methyl - 23 - eneanalogues , respectively , have been analyzed in comparison with VD . Both compounds show about 2 - fold lower affinity to the VD receptor ( VDR ) than VD . However , compared to VD , their antiproliferative effect is up to 30 - fold higher on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and even up to 300 - fold higher on human breast cancer MCF - 7 cells . Whereas the hypercalcemic effect for ZK157202 is also increased 10 - fold , ZK161422 has the same calcium - mobilizing potency as VD . Calcium - dependent immediate - early gene induction in lymphocytes is negatively regulated by p21Ha - ras . The induction of immediate - early ( IE ) response genes , such as egr - 1 , c - fos , and c - jun , occurs rapidly after the activation of T lymphocytes . p21 ( ras ) , a guanine nucleotide binding factor , mediates T - cell signal transduction through PKC - dependent and PKC - independent pathways . We have investigated the inductions of the IE genes in response to calcium signals in Jurkat cells ( in the presence of activated p21 ( ras ) ) and their correlated consequences . This inhibition of calcium - activated IE gene induction was reversed by treatment with cyclosporin A , suggesting the involvement of calcineurin in this regulation . These results suggest that p2l ( ras ) is an essential mediator in generating not only positive but also negative modulatory mechanisms controlling the competence of T cells in response to inductive stimulations . The interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) promoter consists of several independent T cell receptor ( TcR ) responsive elements . The induction of promoters dependent on these elements is inhibitable by the immunosuppressants cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and tacrolimus ( FK - 506 ) . Calcineurin , a Ca2 + / calmodulin - dependent protein phosphatase , is the FK - 506 - and CsA - sensitive enzyme required for TcR mediated activation of the IL - 2 promoter . We report that a constitutively active form of calcineurin partially substitutes for the Ca2 + co - stimulus required to activate the IL - 2 promoter elements IL - 2A ( which binds the factors OAP and Oct - 1 ) and IL - 2E ( which binds NF - AT ) , and completely substitutes for the Ca2 + co - stimulus required to stimulate an NF - kappa B - dependent element . These data provide the first demonstration in vivo that activation of a protein phosphatase can inactivate I kappa B , and suggest one possible explanation for mechanism - based toxicities associated with FK - 506 and CsA by demonstrating that these drugs can inhibit the calcineurin - dependent activation of a virtually ubiquitous transcription factor . Detection of minimal residual disease in a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia by RT - PCR : necessity of chemotherapy following ATRA therapy . The PML / RAR alpha fusion gene resulting from the t ( 15 ; 17 ) translocation is a specific marker for acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) . We examined bone marrow cells by reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) to detect residual PML / RAR alpha mRNA - containing cells following treatment with all - trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) and cytotoxic chemotherapy in a patient with APL . This RT - PCR assay can detect one leukemic cell in 10 ( 2 ) normal cells in vitro . We show that PML / RAR alpha mRNA was still detectable despite clinical remission following ATRA treatment , but undetectable following consolidation with chemotherapy . These data show that this technique is useful for the identification of minimal residual disease in patients with APL and that cytotoxic chemotherapy following ATRA therapy is required for the elimination of APL cells . Glucocorticoid - mediated inhibition of interleukin - 2 receptor alpha and - beta subunit expression by human T cells . To determine the mechanism of glucocorticoid ( GC ) - mediated inhibition of T cell functions , the effect of dexamethasone ( DM ) on T cell proliferation and interleukin - 2 receptor ( IL - 2R ) generation were studied . Dexamethasone inhibited IL - 2 - induced T cell proliferation by 30 % - 88 % , relative to its concentration within the cultures . The effect of DM on expression of IL - 2R alpha ( Tac , p55 , CD25 ) and beta ( p75 ) genes in activated T cells was examined next . In T cells stimulated with purified phytohemagglutinin ( PHA - p ) and 4 beta - phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) addition of DM to the cultures resulted in a 60 % reduction in IL - 2R alpha and a 30 % reduction in IL - 2R beta membrane expression compared to T cells cultured in the absence of DM ( p < 0 . 01 ) . By Northern blot analysis , DM caused a comparable decrease in IL - 2R alpha and in IL - 2R beta mRNA levels to membrane receptor expression in mitogen - stimulated T cells . By in vitro transcription assays , DM regulated IL - 2R alpha gene expression at a transcriptional level while transcription of IL - 2R beta gene was unaffected by DM . The data indicate that 10 ( - 6 ) M DM increased T cell p50 NF - kappa B mRNA levels by four - fold compared to the levels obtained in the absence of DM . Further , the level of nuclear proteins capable of binding to the NF - kappa B sites in activated T cells increased in response to DM . In sum , DM regulates T cell membrane expression of IL - 2R by more than one molecular mechanism . Alteration of structural order of human erythrocyte ghost membrane by glucocorticoids and the influence of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU 486 . High - dose pulse glucocorticoid therapy has been used successfully in the clinic in severe pathological conditions for about 20 years . The mode of glucocorticoid action after administration of such megadoses is inexplicable up to now . It is supposed that some effects may be due to membrane alterations . In the present in - vitro experiments the effect of dexamethasone , of further glucocorticoids , and of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU 486 , on structural order of human erythrocyte ghost membranes was investigated by determining the steady - state fluorescence anisotropy of diphenylhexatriene ( DPH ) . Dexamethasone was found to induce a significant decrease in membrane structural order at concentrations of about 10 ( - 6 ) M in a concentration - dependent manner . We found a correlation between the uptake of dexamethasone by the ghost membranes and the decrease in the structural order . The other glucocorticoids tested , methylprednisolone and corticosterone , were also effective at concentrations of 10 ( - 5 ) M or greater . We observed no change in membrane structural order with RU 486 up to a concentration of 10 ( - 4 ) M . Thus , the glucocorticoid - induced membrane perturbation , the possibility to inhibit it by RU 486 , and the inactivity of the structurally related progesterone , refer to relatively specific binding sites for the glucocorticoids in the membrane of erythrocyte ghosts . Mutation of tyrosines 492 / 493 in the kinase domain of ZAP - 70 affects multiple T - cell receptor signaling pathways . We overexpressed in the Jurkat T - cell line ZAP - 70 mutated on Tyr - 492 and Tyr - 493 in the putative regulatory loop of its kinase domain . This mutant inhibited TCR - induced activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells by interfering with both intracellular calcium increase and Ras - regulated activation of extracellular signal - regulated kinases . Moreover , TCR - induced phosphorylation of pp36 - 38 , thought to play a role upstream of these pathways , was found to be reduced . In contrast , overexpression of wild - type ZAP - 70 induced constitutive activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells . The ZAP - 70 mutant studied here could be phosphorylated on tyrosine when associated to the TCR zeta chain and was able to bind p56 ( lck ) . This result demonstrates that Tyr - 492 and Tyr - 493 are not responsible for the Src homology domain 2 - mediated association of p56 ( lck ) with ZAP - 70 . Our data are most consistent with a model in which recruitment to the TCR allows ZAP - 70 autophosphorylation and binding to p56 ( lck ) , which in turn phosphorylates Tyr - 492 and / or Tyr - 493 with consequent up - regulation of the ZAP - 70 kinase activity . Effects of glucocorticoids on lymphocyte activation in patients with steroid - sensitive and steroid - resistant asthma . BACKGROUND : Glucocorticoids are important medications used to control the airway inflammation associated with asthma . Synthetic glucocorticoids vary in their binding affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor ( GCR ) . METHODS : We compared hydrocortisone , beclomethasone dipropionate , triamcinolone acetonide , flunisolide , and budesonide with regard to their capacity to inhibit phytohemagglutinin - induced peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation from six patients with steroid - sensitive asthma and seven patients with steroid - resistant asthma . RESULTS : Dose - dependent inhibition was demonstrated for all glucocorticoids in both patient groups , with the steroid - resistant group requiring approximately 2 log - fold more glucocorticoids for an equivalent degree of inhibition . The mean concentrations necessary to cause 50 % inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation ( IC50s ) for the steroid - sensitive group ranged from 2 x 10 ( - 10 ) mol / L for budesonide to 7 x 10 ( - 8 ) mol / L for hydrocortisone , whereas the mean IC50s for the steroid - resistant group ranged from approximately 2 x 10 ( - 8 ) mol / L for budesonide to greater than 10 ( - 6 ) mol / L for hydrocortisone . In addition , a significant correlation was noted between the degree of inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation ( IC50 ) and the binding affinity of dexamethasone to the GCR . Patients with steroid - resistant asthma have been shown to have a reduced GCR binding affinity . CONCLUSION : These data suggest that glucocorticoids such as budesonide , by virtue of their high GCR binding affinities and greater ability to suppress lymphocyte proliferation , may therefore be beneficial in the management of difficult - to - control asthma . The cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 plays an important role in regulating cell - cycle progression . p27Kip1 directly inhibits the catalytic activity of cyclin / cdks ( cyclin - dependent kinase ) complexes and / or interferes physically with cyclin / cdks activation by CAK . Interestingly , the expression level of p27Kip1 mRNA was maximal in resting Go T - cells and rapidly declined following anti - CD3 activation . We report here the cloning of p27Kip1 gene from murine genomic DNA and the functional analysis of the promoter of the p27Kip1 gene . The promoter region lacked a TATA box but contained potential binding sites for the transcriptional factors including two Sp1 , CRE , Myb and NFkB located at positions - 153 , - 178 , - 286 , - 875 , and - 1011 , respectively . To analyze the regulatory mechanisms controlling p27Kip1 gene expression , we characterized the 5 ' - flanking region from nt - 1609 to + 178 . Nuclear NF - ATp is a hallmark of unstimulated B cells from B - CLL patients . B lymphocytes from the peripheral blood of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia ( CLL ) were analysed for the nuclear presence and DNA binding of a panel of transcription factors which are involved in the gene control of lymphoid cells . The following transcription factors were studied : the Octamer factors Oct - 1 and Oct - 2 , members of the AP - 1 factor family , NF - AT factors , in particular NF - ATp , and members of the Rel / NF - kB family . We show that the constitutive nuclear translocation of NF - ATp , a member of the growing family of NF - AT factors , is a hallmark of nonstimulated B cells from CLL patients that distinguishes B - CLL cells from ' normal ' B lymphocytes . Constitutive binding of further factor proteins to DNA , such as JunD , c - Fos and FosB , was detected in several patients whereas the localisation and DNA binding of other factors such as c - Jun , RelA / p65 and c - Rel was unaltered . It is remarkable that in B - CLL cells the nuclear appearance and DNA binding of specific transcription factors is dramatically affected whereas other members of the same factor family remained unaltered in these leukemic cells . It remains to be shown which molecular events lead to the specific ' pre - activation ' , i . e . constitutive nuclear translocation and DNA binding , of these members of NF - AT , NF - kB and AP - 1 factor families . Naive ( CD45RA + ) T lymphocytes are more sensitive to oxidative stress - induced signals than memory ( CD45RO + ) cells . Formation of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROI ) after oxidative stress has been shown to be an activation signal for T lymphocytes , e . g . , expression of IL - 2 and its receptor are induced . These ROI - induced effects can , to a large extent , be attributed to the activation of the transcription factor NF - kappaB . Now we have examined whether naive and memory T lymphocytes differ in their sensitivity to ROI - mediated signals . When CD45RA + ( naive ) and CD45RO + ( memory ) T lymphocytes were directly stimulated with H2O2 , NF - kappaB nuclear translocation was stronger in naive cells than in memory cells and it could be induced with lower doses . The composition of the induced nuclear NF - kappaB ( levels of p50 and RelA proteins ) was similar in these cell types . The magnitude and kinetics of intracellular ROI were similar , suggesting that there were no differences in ROI - forming mechanisms or antioxidative capacities . The probable regulatory point was the cytoplasmic IkappaB inhibitor : in CD45RA + cells , H2O2 caused a more profound depression in the levels of IkappaB alpha . Rapid shuttling of NF - AT in discrimination of Ca2 + signals and immunosuppression . Cells need to distinguish between transient Ca2 + signals that induce events such as muscle contraction , secretion , adhesion and synaptic transmission , and sustained Ca2 + signals that are involved in cell proliferation and differentiation . The latter class of events is blocked in lymphocytes by the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506 , which inhibit calcineurin , a Ca2 + - activated serine / threonine phosphatase necessary for the nuclear import of NF - AT transcription factors . Here we report that sustained high concentrations of Ca2 + , but not transient pulses , are required to maintain NF - AT transcription factors in the nucleus , where they participate in Ca2 + - dependent induction of genes required for lymphocyte activation and proliferation . Thus a primary effect of these immunosuppressive reagents is to control the subcellular localization of the NF - AT family of transcription factors . Autoregulation of the NF - kappa B transactivator RelA ( p65 ) by multiple cytoplasmic inhibitors containing ankyrin motifs . RelA ( p65 ) functions as the critical transactivating component of the heterodimeric p50 - p65 NF - kappa B complex and contains a high - affinity binding site for its cytoplasmic inhibitor , I kappa B alpha . After cellular activation , I kappa B alpha is rapidly degraded in concert with the induced nuclear translocation of NF - kappa B . The present study demonstrates that tumor necrosis factor alpha - induced degradation of I kappa B alpha in human T cells is preceded by its rapid phosphorylation in vivo . However , these effects on I kappa B alpha result in nuclear mobilization of only a fraction of the entire cytoplasmic pool of RelA . Subsequent studies have revealed that ( i ) cytoplasmic RelA is stably associated not only with I kappa B alpha but also with other ankyrin motif - rich proteins including the products of the NF - kappa B2 ( p100 ) and NF - kappa B1 ( p105 ) genes ; ( ii ) in contrast to RelA - I kappa B alpha , RelA - p100 cytoplasmic complexes are not dissociated following tumor necrosis factor alpha activation ; ( iii ) p100 functions as a potent inhibitor of RelA - mediated transcription in vivo ; ( iv ) the interaction of RelA and p100 involves the conserved Rel homology domain of both proteins but not the nuclear localization signal of RelA , which is required for I kappa B alpha binding ; ( v ) p100 inhibition of RelA function requires the C - terminal ankyrin motif domain , which mediates cytoplasmic retention of RelA ; and ( vi ) as observed with I kappa B alpha , nuclear RelA stimulates p100 mRNA and protein expression . Effects of CD45 on NF - kappa B . Increased levels of replication of the HIV type 1 are observed after the activation of infected T cells through the TCR . However , anti - CD45 antibodies inhibit these effects in cells from infected individuals . In this study , we examined interrelationships between CD45 and HIV - 1 further . We measured effects on the HIV - 1 LTR in T cell lines that were stimulated with antibodies against CD45 and in those that lacked the expression of CD45 on their surfaces . Second , T cells , which lack CD45 and can not signal via the TCR , supported higher levels of viral replication and gene expression . This was due to the presence of active NF - kappa B complexes in the nucleus of CD45 - T cells . Additionally , infected T cells displayed lower levels of CD45 on their surfaces . Thus , CD45 plays an active role in the physiology of T cells and in the replication of HIV - 1 . Calcineurin potentiates activation of the granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor gene in T cells : involvement of the conserved lymphokine element 0 . Granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) and interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) are produced by stimulation with phorbol - 12 - myristate acetate ( PMA ) and calcium ionophore ( A23187 ) in human T cell leukemia Jurkat cells . Earlier studies on the IL - 2 gene expression showed that overexpression of calcineurin ( CN ) , a Ca2 + / calmodulin - dependent protein phosphatase , can stimulate transcription from the IL - 2 promoter through the NF - AT - binding site . In this study , we obtained evidence that transfection of the cDNAs for CN A ( catalytic ) and CN B ( regulatory ) subunits also augments transcription from the GM - CSF promoter and recovers the transcription inhibited by CsA . We also found that the active CN partially replaces calcium ionophore in synergy with PMA to induce expression of endogenous GM - CSF and IL - 2 . By multimerizing the regulatory elements of the GM - CSF promoter , we found that one of the target sites for the CN action is the conserved lymphokine element 0 ( CLE0 ) , located at positions between - 54 and - 40 . Mobility shift assays showed that the CLE0 sequence has an AP1 - binding site and is associated with an NF - AT - like factor , termed NF - CLE0 gamma . NF - CLE0 gamma binding is induced by PMA / A23187 and is inhibited by treatment with CsA . These results suggest that CN is involved in the coordinated induction of the GM - CSF and IL - 2 genes and that the CLE0 sequence of the GM - CSF gene is a functional analogue of the NF - AT - binding site in the IL - 2 promoter , which mediates signals downstream of T cell activation . We here summarize evidence that thymic atrophy induced by 2 , 3 , 7 , 8 - tetrachlorodibenzo - p - dioxin ( TCDD ) can be mediated , at least in part , by damage to extrathymic T - cell precursors in bone marrow and fetal liver . This atrophy induction does not involve apoptotic mechanisms in thymocytes affected by the bcl - 2 proto - oncogene . These extrathymic T - cell populations include cells expressing elevated levels of V beta T - cell receptors that are normally deleted in thymic development . Identification of Bcd , a novel proto - oncogene expressed in B - cells . A novel B - cell derived ( Bcd ) oncogene has been isolated from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of one B - cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( B - CLL ) patient using DNA transfer and a mouse tumorigenicity assay . The Bcd proto - oncogene was activated by a truncation in the 5 ' UTR . Predicted peptide sequence of ORF2 contained a zinc finger domain which showed significant homology to GC box binding proteins BTEB2 and SP1 . Transfection of an expression vector containing ORF2 but not full length cDNA was able to transform NIH3T3 cells and induce tumors in nude mice . Bcd mRNA transcripts of < or = 2 . 6 kb were selectively expressed in PBL and testis of healthy individuals . Within the PBL , Bcd gene expression was restricted to CD19 + B - cells and absent from CD14 + monocytes and T - cells . Bcd transcripts were detected in all normal PBL samples tested but not in several malignant human B - cell lines and not in 50 % of B - cells from B - CLL patients . However , stimulation of B - cells from B - CLL patients under conditions which induced differentiation into plasma cells was associated with induction of Bcd gene expression . The Bcd gene may therefore play an important role in B - cell growth and development . A novel SP - 1 site in the human interleukin - 1 beta promoter confers preferential transcriptional activity in keratinocytes . We identified a promoter segment that activates transcription most efficiently in keratinocytes . Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) with a 43 - mer oligonucleotide derived from the functionally identified cis - acting element revealed specific complexes . By competition analysis with transcription factor consensus sequence oligonucleotides and by immunosupershift , transcription factor SP - 1 or a closely related protein was shown to bind to this regulatory element . The closest match to the known SP - 1 consensus sequence within the respective region is a TCCCCTCCCCT motif . Mutation of this motif almost completely , and specifically , abolished the binding of two low - mobility complexes and led to a 95 % decrease of constitutive transcriptional activation of a reporter construct IL - 1beta ( - 170 / + 108 ) . Likewise , activation of this reporter construct by tumor necrosis factor - alpha depended on the SP - 1 site . These observations suggest that a so - far - unrecognized SP - 1 site in the human IL - 1beta promoter may participate in the transcriptional regulation of this gene in keratinocytes . Expression of Egr - 1 correlates with the transformed phenotype and the type of viral latency in EBV genome positive lymphoid cell lines . In this paper we have investigated the role of Egr - 1 in B cell growth regulation by examining the gene expression in a panel of B cell lines , including both EBV genome negative and EBV carrying cell lines . Thus , constitutive activation of Egr - 1 gene is invariably associated with unrestricted expression of viral latent genes in all group III EBV genome carrying cell lines . In contrast , Egr - 1 expression is abrogated in group I Burkitt tumor cells , irrespective of the EBV genome carrying status . Activated viral gene expression associated with phenotypic conversion of group I cell lines in to group II or III restores the Egr - 1 gene expression . Finally , time course analysis of Egr - 1 expression during the early steps of EBV infection in vitro demonstrated that Egr - 1 is upregulated within minutes from the initial interaction with the B lymphocyte . Expression of erythroid - specific genes in megakaryoblastic disorders . Currently available data indicate that erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation pathways are closely related to each other , and there may exist progenitor cells common to those two lineages may exist . Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia ( AML - M7 ) and transient myeloproliferative disorder in Down ' s syndrome ( TMD ) are characterized by rapid growth of abnormal blast cells which express megakaryocytic markers . These blast cells express lineage - specific transcription factors such as GATA - 1 common to these lineages and frequently express erythroid - specific mRNAs such as gamma - globin and erythroid delta - aminolevulinate synthase ( ALAS - E ) , indicating that most of the blasts in M7 and TMD cases have erythroid and megakaryocytic phenotypes . These results suggest that blasts in M7 and TMD may correspond to progenitors of both erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages . Stat3 recruitment by two distinct ligand - induced , tyrosine - phosphorylated docking sites in the interleukin - 10 receptor intracellular domain . Recent work has shown that IL - 10 induces activation of the JAK - STAT signaling pathway . To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) protein recruitment to the interleukin 10 ( IL - 10 ) receptor , the STAT proteins activated by IL - 10 in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays . IL - 10 also activated Stat5 in Ba / F3 cells that stably expressed the murine IL - 10 receptor . Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL - 10 - induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell - free system . In contrast , tyrosine - phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation . These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand - activated IL - 10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine . A switch from human fetal ( gamma ) - to adult ( beta ) - globin expression occurs within erythroid precursor cells of the adult lineage . Previously we and others showed by targeted gene disruption that the zinc finger gene , erythroid Kruppel - like factor ( EKLF ) , is required for expression of the beta - globin gene in mice , presumably through interaction with a high - affinity binding site in the proximal promoter . To examine the role of EKLF in the developmental regulation of the human gamma - globin gene we interbred EKLF heterozygotes ( + / - ) with mice harboring a human beta - globin yeast artificial chromosome transgene . We find that in the absence of EKLF , while human beta - globin expression is dramatically reduced , gamma - globin transcripts are elevated approximately 5 - fold . Impaired silencing of gamma - globin expression identifies EKLF as the first transcription factor participating quantitatively in the gamma - globin to beta - globin switch . Our findings are compatible with a competitive model of switching in which EKLF mediates an adult stage - specific interaction between the beta - globin gene promoter and the locus control region that excludes the gamma - globin gene . Zinc is an important trace element for immune function . Here , we show that zinc addition in a serum - and lipopolysaccharide - free cell culture system leads to significantly enhanced levels of interleukin 1 beta ( IL - 1 beta ) and tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - alpha ) and to expression of the corresponding mRNA in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) . Structurally related divalent cations like cobalt , nickel , and mercury also partially increase monokine secretion but to a much lower and thus insignificant extent . They fail to induce mRNA of TNF - alpha after 3 h of culture . Retinoic acid ( RA ) - induced maturation mediated by the retinoic acid receptor alpha ( RAR alpha ) has been implicated in myeloid development . We have used differential hybridization analysis of a cDNA library constructed from the murine RA - inducible MPRO promyelocyte cell line to identify immediate - early genes induced by RA during granulocytic differentiation . However , when HL60R cells were transduced with a functional copy of the RAR alpha gene , RA induced a 10 - fold increase in E3 mRNA levels . E3 transcripts are present in the myeloid , B - lymphoid , and erythroid lineages , absent in nonhematopoietic cells , and encode a highly hydrophobic , potentially phosphorylated polypeptide of unknown function with significant homology to a putative protein expressed in myeloid cells . The murine E3 promoter harbors a single bipartite retinoic acid response element which in transient transfection assays conferred RA sensitivity . Multifactor cis - dominant negative regulation of IL - 2 gene expression in anergized T cells . This construct was only slightly reduced ( 1 . 3 - fold ) in its expression when stimulated under anergic conditions , while a whole mouse IL - 2 enhancer construct showed a reduction of 4 . 3 - fold . Addition of the - 176 to - 96 sequence to the 4X NF - AT - Oct construct did not impart the ability to be affected by anergy , but addition of the - 236 to - 96 sequence did , demonstrating that anergy is an active inhibitory process and that more than the presence of the - 150 AP - 1 binding site ( - 152 to - 147 ) is required to mediate the effect . Mutational studies of the - 236 to - 96 sequence indicated that the presence of both the - 130 AP - 1 - like site ( - 187 to - 181 ) and the - 150 proximal AP - 1 site were necessary to observe anergy . Because the - 180 site is not required for trans - activation , it was possible to confirm by mutation in the normal mouse IL - 2 enhancer that this site is absolutely essential for anergy induction . Severe combined immunodeficiency due to defective binding of the nuclear factor of activated T cells in T lymphocytes of two male siblings . Peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) and alloreactive T cell lines of two male infants born to consanguinous parents and presenting with severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID ) showed a pronounced deficiency in T cell activation . Although phenotypically normal , the proliferative response of the childrens ' T cells was strongly reduced but could be improved by the addition of interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) . Furthermore both childrens ' T cells were unable to produce the cytokines IL - 2 , interferon - gamma ( IFN - gamma ) , IL - 4 and tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF - alpha ) . This multiple cytokine production deficiency could not be restored by IL - 2 or co - stimulatory signals provided by antigen - presenting cells ( APC ) . Moreover , mRNA for IL - 2 and IFN - gamma could not be detected . To determine whether the functional defect of the patients ' T cells was due to the absence or abnormal binding of transcription factors involved in cytokine gene expression , electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to examine the DNA binding of AP - 1 , Oct , CREB , SP1 , NF - kappa B and the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF - AT ) to their respective response elements in the promoter of the IL - 2 gene . oriP is essential for EBNA gene promoter activity in Epstein - Barr virus - immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines . Upon infection , Wp is initially active , followed by a switch to Cp for the duration of latency . In this study , the region upstream of Cp was analyzed for the presence of cis elements involved in regulating the activities of the EBNA gene promoters in established in vitro immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCLs ) . It was determined that oriP , the origin for episomal maintenance during latency , is essential for efficient transcription initiation from either Cp or Wp in LCLs , as well as in some Burkitt ' s lymphoma cell lines . More extensive deletion of sequences upstream of Cp , including the EBNA2 - dependent enhancer , resulted in nearly complete loss of Cp activity . This loss of activity was shown to correlate with deletion of two CCAAT boxes , a proximal CCAAT box located at bp - 61 to - 65 and a distal CCAAT box located at bp - 253 to - 257 , upstream of Cp . Site - directed mutagenesis of these cis elements demonstrated that Cp activity is highly dependent on the presence of a properly positioned CCAAT box , with the dependence on the distal CCAAT box apparent only when the proximal CCAAT box was deleted or mutated . In general , deletions which diminished Cp activity resulted in induction of Wp activity , consistent with suppression of Wp activity by transcriptional interference from Cp . Protein - tyrosine kinase activation is required for lipopolysaccharide induction of interleukin 1beta and NFkappaB activation , but not NFkappaB nuclear translocation . In human monocytes , interleukin 1beta protein production and steady state mRNA levels are increased in response to lipopolysaccharide , predominantly as a result of increased transcription of the interleukin 1beta gene . Since recent studies have shown that lipopolysaccharide - induced tyrosine kinase activation is not required for NFkappaB nuclear translocation , we sought to determine whether NFkappaB translocated in the absence of tyrosine kinase activity was active in stimulating transcription . We have found that , in the human pro - monocytic cell line , THP - 1 , the lipopolysaccharide - induced expression of interleukin 1beta is dependent on tyrosine kinase activation . Tyrosine kinases are not required for lipopolysaccharide - mediated nuclear translocation of NFkappaB . However , in the absence of tyrosine kinase activity , the ability of NFkappaB to stimulate transcription is impaired . This inhibition of transcription is specific for NFkappaB ; in the absence of tyrosine kinase activity , AP - 1 - dependent transcription is enhanced . These results suggest that , while lipopolysaccharide - induced expression of inflammatory mediators requires tyrosine kinase activity , tyrosine kinase activity is not obligatory for lipopolysaccharide signal transduction . Chronic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection of myeloid cells disrupts the autoregulatory control of the NF - kappaB / Rel pathway via enhanced IkappaBalpha degradation . Productive human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) infection causes sustained NF - kappaB DNA - binding activity in chronically infected monocytic cells . A direct temporal correlation exists between HIV infection and the appearance of NF - kappaB DNA - binding activity in myelomonoblastic PLB - 985 cells . To examine the molecular basis of constitutive NF - kappaB DNA - binding activity in HIV1 - infected cells , we analyzed the phosphorylation and turnover of IkappaBalpha protein , the activity of the double - stranded RNA - dependent protein kinase ( PKR ) and the intracellular levels of NF - kappaB subunits in the PLB - 985 and U937 myeloid cell models . Constitutive PKR activity was also detected in HIV - 1 - infected cells as a result of low - level IFN production , since the addition of anti - IFN - alpha / beta antibody to the cells decreased PKR expression . Furthermore , the analysis of IkappaBalpha turnover demonstrated an increased degradation of IkappaBalpha in HIV - 1 - infected cells that may account for the constitutive DNA binding activity . A dramatic increase in the intracellular levels of NF - kappaB subunits c - Rel and NF - kappaB2 p100 and a moderate increase in NF - kappaB2 p52 and RelA ( p65 ) were detected in HIV - 1 - infected cells , whereas NF - kappaB1 p105 / p50 levels were not altered relative to the levels in uninfected cells . Enhanced turnover of IkappaBalpha and the accumulation of NF - kappaB / Rel proteins may contribute to the chronically activated state of HIV - 1 - infected cells . The c - Jun delta - domain inhibits neuroendocrine promoter activity in a DNA sequence - and pituitary - specific manner . We have previously shown that c - Jun is a potent inhibitor of the rat prolactin ( rPRL ) promoter activity induced by either oncogenic Ras or phorbol esters . Here , we have characterized the structural and cell - specific requirements for this c - Jun inhibitory response , and we show that this c - Jun inhibitory response mapped to the rPRL footprint II repressor site , was pituitary - specific and required the c - Jun delta - domain . Moreover , alteration of any one of these features ( e . g . , cis - element , trans - factor , or cell - specific background ) switched c - Jun to a transcriptional activator of the rPRL promoter . In HeLa nonpituitary cells , c - Jun alone activated the rPRL promoter via the most proximal GHF - 1 / Pit - 1 binding site , footprint I , and synergized with GHF - 1 . Finally , recombinant GHF - 1 interacted directly with c - Jun but not c - Fos proteins . These data provide important fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms by which the c - Jun delta - domain functions as a modulatory switch and further imply that the functional role of c - Jun is dictated by cell - specific influences and the delta - domain motif . Retinoic acid activates interferon regulatory factor - 1 gene expression in myeloid cells . All - trans - retinoic acid ( ATRA ) is the drug of choice in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) . ATRA induces both in vitro and in vivo differentiation of APL cells into mature granulocytes . However , the molecular mechanisms involved in ATRA - dependent growth inhibition and cellular differentiation are not presently understood . The NB4 cell line , which is derived from the bone marrow of a patient with APL during relapse , can be used as a model system to study the growth and differentiation of APL cells . Because interferon ( IFN ) regulatory factors ( IRF - 1 and IRF - 2 ) and other IFN - inducible gene products regulate cell growth , we analyzed the effects of ATRA on the expression of these genes . We show that ATRA directly activates IRF - 1 gene expression , followed by activation of IRF - 2 and 2 ' - 5 ' oligoadenylate synthetase ( OAS ) gene expression with slower kinetics . In addition to NB4 cells , ATRA also activated IRF - 1 gene expression in HL - 60 , U937 , and THP - 1 cells , which all respond to ATRA by growth inhibition . A more than additive increase in IRF - 1 gene expression was seen with ATRA and IFN - gamma in NB4 cells . ATRA did not activate nuclear factor kappa B or signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) activation pathways , suggesting that an alternate mechanism is involved in IRF - 1 gene activation . The ATRA - induced expression of IRF - 1 , an activator of transcription and repressor of transformation , may be one of the molecular mechanisms of ATRA - induced growth inhibition , and the basis for the synergistic actions of ATRA and IFNs in myeloid leukemia cells . Recombinant NFAT1 ( NFATp ) is regulated by calcineurin in T cells and mediates transcription of several cytokine genes . Transcription factors of the NFAT family play a key role in the transcription of cytokine genes and other genes during the immune response . We have identified two new isoforms of the transcription factor NFAT1 ( previously termed NFATp ) that are the predominant isoforms expressed in murine and human T cells . When expressed in Jurkat T cells , recombinant NFAT1 is regulated , as expected , by the calmodulin - dependent phosphatase calcineurin , and its function is inhibited by the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporin A ( CsA ) . Transactivation by recombinant NFAT1 in Jurkat T cells requires dual stimulation with ionomycin and phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ; this activity is potentiated by coexpression of constitutively active calcineurin and is inhibited by CsA . Immunocytochemical analysis indicates that recombinant NFAT1 localizes in the cytoplasm of transiently transfected T cells and translocates into the nucleus in a CsA - sensitive manner following ionomycin stimulation . When expressed in COS cells , however , NFAT1 is capable of transactivation , but it is not regulated correctly : its subcellular localization and transcriptional function are not affected by stimulation of the COS cells with ionomycin and phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate . Recombinant NFAT1 can mediate transcription of the interleukin - 2 , interleukin - 4 , tumor necrosis factor alpha , and granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor promoters in T cells , suggesting that NFAT1 contributes to the CsA - sensitive transcription of these genes during the immune response . Human TAFII 105 is a cell type - specific TFIID subunit related to hTAFII130 . We previously characterized Drosophila and human TAF subunits that make up the core TFIID complex found in all cells . The cDNA encoding hTAFII105 reveals a highly conserved C - terminal domain shared by hTAFII130 and oTAFII110 , while the N - terminal coactivator domain has diverged significantly . Transient overexpression of hTAFII105 selectively squelches the transcription of some genes in B cells . These properties suggest that TAFII105 is a cell type - specific subunit of TFIID that may be responsible for mediating transcription by a subset of activators in B cells . Interstitial deletion constitutes the major mechanism for loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 20q in polycythemia vera . An acquired deletion of the long arm of chromosome 20 is a recurrent abnormality in myeloproliferative disorders , particularly polycythemia vera and myelodysplastic syndromes . We have recently performed a detailed molecular analysis of 20q deletions in peripheral blood ( PB ) granulocytes and defined a commonly deleted region of 16 to 21 centimorgan ( cM ) . To further reduce the size of the common deleted region we have searched for small deletions or mitotic recombination events , neither of which would be detected by conventional cytogenetics . We have studied 48 patients with polycythemia vera and four patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis . In each case , cytogenetic analysis had either failed or had shown no abnormalities of chromosome 20 . No instance of microsatellite instability was observed in a total of 880 comparisons of granulocyte and T - cell DNA . Granulocyte DNA from four patients exhibited allele loss on 20q . In each case the allele loss was caused by an interstitial deletion because heterozygosity at distal markers was retained and because quantitative Southern blotting demonstrated hemizygosity . Loss of heterozygosity in PB granulocytes would be masked by the presence of significant numbers of normal granulocytes not derived from the malignant clone . In 21 of 27 informative female patients the majority of the granulocytes were clonally derived . In 5 patients the granulocytes appeared polyclonal and in 1 patient unilateral X inactivation was observed in both granulocytes and T cells . Our results therefore show that allele loss on chromosome 20q in polycythemia vera does not commonly involve mitotic recombination or chromosome loss and that microsatellite instability is a rare event in this disorder . Interleukin - 6 promotes multiple myeloma cell growth via phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein . Interleukin - 6 ( IL - 6 ) mediates autocrine and paracrine growth of multiple myeloma ( MM ) cells and inhibits tumor cell apoptosis . Abnormalities of retinoblastoma protein ( pRB ) and mutations of RB gene have been reported in up to 70 % of MM patients and 80 % of MM - derived cell lines . Because dephosphorylated ( activated ) pRB blocks transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle whereas phosphorylated ( inactivated ) pRB releases this growth arrest , we characterized the role of pRB in IL - 6 - mediated MM cell growth . Both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated pRB were expressed in all serum - starved MM patient cells and MM - derived cell lines , but pRB was predominantly in its phosphorylated form . In MM cells that proliferated in response to IL - 6 , exogenous IL - 6 downregulated dephosphorylated pRB and decreased dephosphorylated pRB - E2F complexes . Importantly , culture of MM cells with RB antisense , but not RB sense , oligonucleotide ( ODN ) triggered IL - 6 secretion and proliferation in MM cells ; however , proliferation was only partially inhibited by neutralizing anti - IL - 6 monoclonal antibody ( MoAb ) . These results suggest that phosphorylated pRB is constitutively expressed in MM cells and that IL - 6 further shifts pRB from its dephosphorylated to its phosphorylated form , thereby promoting MM cell growth via two mechanisms ; by decreasing the amount of E2F bound by dephosphorylated pRB due to reduced dephosphorylated pRB , thereby releasing growth arrest ; and by upregulating IL - 6 secretion by MM cells and related IL - 6 - mediated autocrine tumor cell growth . Coordination of the immune response to injury or disease in the brain is postulated to involve bi - directional discourse between the immune system and the central nervous system . This cross communication involves soluble mediators , including various growth factors , cytokines , and neuropeptides . In this report , we demonstrate that the supernatant from activated T - lymphocytes is able to induce the transcription of a potent cytokine , TGF - beta 2 in glial cells . The activating stimulus invokes signaling mechanisms distinct from known kinase or protease pathways . Activation of TGF - beta 2 transcription correlates with the loss of binding activity for an 80 kDA glial labile repressor protein , GLRP , to a responsive region within the TFG - beta 2 promoter . Although GLRP shares some characteristics with the inducible transcription factor AP - 1 , it appears to be distinct from known AP - 1 family members . Various modes of basic helix - loop - helix protein - mediated regulation of murine leukemia virus transcription in lymphoid cell lines . One type , EA / S , is located in the upstream promoter region , and the other , E ( gre ) , is located in a tandem repeat with enhancer properties . Ectopic ALF1 and E2A proteins required intact E ( gre ) motifs for mediating transcriptional activation . In T - and B - cell lines , the E ( gre ) motifs were of major importance for Akv MLV transcriptional activity , while the EA / S motif had some effect . In contrast , neither E ( gre ) nor EA / S motifs contributed pronouncedly to Akv MLV transcription in NIH 3T3 cells lacking DNA - binding ALF1 or HEB and E2A proteins . The Id1 protein was found to repress ALF1 activity in vitro and in vivo . The E2A - HLF ( for hepatic leukaemia factor ) fusion gene , formed by action of the t ( 17 ; 19 ) ( q22 ; p13 ) chromosomal translocation , drives the leukaemic transformation of early B - cell precursors , but the mechanism of this activity remains unknown . Here we report that human leukaemia cells carrying the translocation t ( 17 ; 19 ) rapidly died by apoptosis when programmed to express a dominant - negative suppressor of the fusion protein E2A - HLF , indicating that the chimaeric oncoprotein probably affects cell survival rather than cell growth . Moreover , when introduced into murine pro - B lymphocytes , the oncogenic E2A - HLF fusion protein reversed both interleukin - 3 - dependent and p53 - mediated apoptosis . The close homology of the basic region / leucine zipper ( bZIP ) DNA - binding and dimerization domain of HLF to that of the CES - 2 cell - death specification protein of Caenorhabditis elegans suggests a model of leukaemogenesis in which E2A - HLF blocks an early step within an evolutionarily conserved cell - death pathway . The role of early growth response gene 1 ( egr - 1 ) in regulation of the immune response . The induction of immediate early genes in cells of the immune system is critical to determining the ultimate outcome of exposure to antigen . The importance of many of these genes relates to the role their transcription factor products play in dictating patterns of expression of downstream , function - related genes . Evidence from several systems indicates that the immediate early gene , egr - 1 may be of particular importance in the immune system . Recently , the egr - 1 promoter has been shown to be highly responsive to the diverse biochemical signals generated by antigen and cytokines in cells of the immune system . Furthermore , an important role for egr - 1 in determining the differentiation pathway of myeloid cell precursors has been recently elaborated . Finally , potential targets of regulation by the zinc - finger transcription factor encoded by egr - 1 include the interleukin - 2 , CD44 , ICAM - 1 , and tumor necrosis factor genes . The role of egr - 1 in regulation of the immune response will be discussed in the context of these recent studies . Peptide vaccination can lead to enhanced tumor growth through specific T - cell tolerance induction . Vaccination with synthetic peptides representing cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) epitopes can lead to a protective CTL - mediated immunity against tumors or viruses . We now report that vaccination with a CTL epitope derived from the human adenovirus type 5 E1A - region ( Ad5E1A234 - 243 ) , which can serve as a target for tumor - eradicating CTL , enhances rather than inhibits the growth of Ad5E1A - expressing tumors . This adverse effect of peptide vaccination was rapidly evoked , required low doses of peptide ( 10 micrograms ) , and was achieved by a mode of peptide delivery that induces protective T - cell - mediated immunity in other models . Ad5E1A - specific CTL activity could no longer be isolated from mice after injection of Ad5E1A - peptide , indicating that tolerization of Ad5E1A - specific CTL activity causes the enhanced tumor outgrowth . In contrast to peptide vaccination , immunization with adenovirus , expressing Ad5E1A , induced Ad5E1A - specific immunity and prevented the outgrowth of Ad5E1A - expressing tumors . These results show that immunization with synthetic peptides can lead to the elimination of anti - tumor CTL responses . These findings are important for the design of safe peptide - based vaccines against tumors , allogeneic organ transplants , and T - cell - mediated autoimmune diseases . [ NGFI - B / nur77 family involved in T - cell apoptosis ] NGFI - B / nur77 is a member of the steroid receptor superfamily . NGFI - B / nur77 and its related genes constitute a family and the NGFI - B / nur77 family consists of three subtypes , named nur77 alpha , nur77 beta , nur77 gamma . NGFI - B / nur77 binds to the response element by monomer or heterodimer with retinoid X receptor ( RXR ) . Assuming that 9 - cis - retinoic acid ( 9 - cis - RA ) inhibits TCR - mediated apoptosis , nur77 may cause apoptosis by monomer in the absence of 9 - cis - RA and may inhibit apoptosis by heterodimer with RXR in the presence of 9 - cis - RA . Glucocorticoids and interferon - alpha in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome . Some patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) develop glucocorticoid resistance characterized by low receptor affinity ( Kd ) for glucocorticoids in mononuclear , cells and high values of ACTH and cortisol . As glucocorticoids regulate interferon - alpha ( IFN alpha ) production , we hypothesized that IFN alpha , a cytokine produced predominantly by monocytes in AIDS , should be increased in cortisol - resistant AIDS , attributing the lack of cortisol inhibition to IFN alpha production . Therefore , we examined glucocorticoid receptor characteristics on monocytes by [ 3H ] dexamethasone binding and measured IFN alpha , cortisol , and ACTH in AIDS patients with ( AIDS - GR ) or without glucocorticoid resistance ( AIDS - C ) and controls ( C ) . Monocytes of AIDS - GR patients had a receptor Kd of 10 . 5 + / - 4 . 2 nmol / L that was higher than that in the AIDS - C group ( 2 . 9 + / - 0 . 8 nmol / L ) and normal subjects ( 2 . 0 + / - 0 . 8 nmol / L ; P < 0 . 01 ) . IFN alpha levels were increased in the AIDS - GR group ( 17 + / - 6 vs . 4 + / - 1 U / mL in the AIDS - C group and 2 + / - 0 . 5 U / mL in the C group ; P < 0 . 01 ) . The poly ( I ) - poly ( C ) - induced IFN alpha production by monocytes was inhibited by glucocorticoids in the C and AIDS - C groups ( approximately 80 % inhibition in both groups ) ; the effect was reversed by the receptor antagonist RU - 38486 . In conclusion , elevated IFN alpha levels in AIDS - GR may be due to the lack of inhibitory effect of cortisol on IFN alpha production due to cortisol resistance in monocytes JNK ( c - Jun NH2 - terminal kinase ) is a target for antioxidants in T lymphocytes . AP - 1 has been shown to behave as a redox - sensitive transcription factor that can be activated by both oxidant and antioxidant stimuli . However , the mechanisms involved in the activation of AP - 1 by antioxidants are largely unknown . In this study we show that the structurally unrelated antioxidant agents pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) , butylated hydroxyanisole , and Nacetylcysteine activated JNK ( c - Jun NH2 - terminal kinase ) in Jurkat T cells . The activation of JNK by classical T cell stimuli was transient , whereas that mediated by PDTC and butylated hydroxyanisole ( but not N - acetylcysteine ) was sustained . The kinetics of JNK activation correlated with the expression of c - jun which was transient after stimulation with PMA plus ionophore and prolonged in response to PDTC , which also transiently induced c - fos . In addition , JNK activation by PMA plus ionophore was sensitive to inhibitors of signaling pathways involving Ca2 + , protein kinase C , and tyrosine phosphorylation , which failed to inhibit the activation mediated by PDTC . Transfection of trans - dominant negative expression vectors of ras and raf , together with AP - 1 - dependent reporter constructs , as well as Western blot analysis using anti - ERK ( extracellular signal - regulated kinase ) antibodies , indicated that the Ras / Raf / ERK pathway did not appear to mediate the effect of the antioxidant . However , the combined treatment with PDTC and PMA , two agents that synergize on AP - 1 activation , resulted in the persistent phosphorylation of ERK - 2 . In conclusion , our results identify JNK as a target of antioxidant agents which can be regulated differentially under oxidant and antioxidant conditions . [ Molecular mechanisms of age - related lymphocyte dysfunction ] Aging is classically accompanied by a dysregulation of the immunologic machinery . As a consequence , the immune response developed in senescent organisms is usually inappropriate , often inefficient , sometimes aberrant , and potentially detrimental . The current understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying immunosenescence is still fragmentary . The most extensively studied phenomenon is the progressive decline in the proliferative capacities of T lymphocytes with aging . The loss of proliferative potential in response to antigenic challenge is a characteristic feature of immune senescence . It is directly implicated in the emergence of the age - related immune deficiency . The purpose of this review is to show how the accumulation of various biochemical lesions with advancing age leads to the failure of a critical cell function , namely the activation - induced lymphocyte proliferation . Levels of bcl - 2 mRNA and protein increase with cross - linking of surface immunoglobulin . We have located the major positive regulatory region for control of bcl - 2 expression in B cells in the 5 ' - flanking region . The positive region can be divided into an upstream and a downstream regulatory region . The downstream regulatory region contains a cyclic AMP - responsive element ( CRE ) . We show by antibody supershift experiments and UV cross - linking followed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that both CREB and ATF family members bind to this region in vitro . Mutations of the CRE site that result in loss of CREB binding also lead to loss of functional activity of the bcl - 2 promoter in transient - transfection assays . The presence of an active CRE site in the bcl - 2 promoter implies that the regulation of bcl - 2 expression is linked to a signal transduction pathway in B cells . Treatment of the mature B - cell line BAL - 17 with either anti - immunoglobulin M or phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate leads to an increase in bcl - 2 expression that is mediated by the CRE site . Treatment of the more immature B - cell line , Ramos , with phorbol esters rescues the cells from calcium - dependent apoptosis . bcl - 2 expression is increased following phorbol ester treatment , and the increased expression is dependent on the CRE site . The phosphorylation of CREB that results in activation is mediated by protein kinase C rather than by protein kinase A . Although the CRE site is necessary , optimal induction of bcl - 2 expression requires participation of the upstream regulatory element , suggesting that phosphorylation of CREB alters its interaction with the upstream regulatory element . The CRE site in the bcl - 2 promoter appears to play a major role in the induction of bcl - 2 expression during the activation of mature B cells and during the rescue of immature B cells from apoptosis . Characterization of the human myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen gene promoter . To identify mechanisms responsible for this lineage - specific and interferon - regulated expression , the 5 ' flanking sequence of the gene has been characterized . Two interferon - stimulated response elements ( ISRE ) flank a multiple transcription start site region identifying MNDA as a TATA - less interferon - regulated gene . Other DNA elements present include a cluster of Myb sites , several Ets , an Ets related PU . 1 site and an Sp1 site located within 600 bp of the transcription start sites . The 5 ' flanking sequence has promoter activity which is elevated by interferon alpha . The findings indicate that MNDA expression is regulated by mechanisms similar to other myelomonocytic cell specific genes and genes up - regulated by interferon alpha . Abnormality of Oct - 1 DNA binding in T cells from Sjogren ' s syndrome patients . Primary Sjogren ' s syndrome ( SS ) is an autoimmune rheumatic disease characterized by T cell hypoactivity . To understand the diminished T cell response to activation signals , we measured nucleoprotein DNA - binding activities regulating gene expression during T cell activation using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay . Peripheral blood lymphocytes from 9 / 19 SS patients were found to be defective in their ability to bind an october sequence ( Oct - 1 ) . This Oct - 1 - binding phenotype remained stable in culture for up to 3 days prior to activation . The SS Oct - 1 DNA - binding abnormality correlated significantly with an inability of cells to exit the Gzero / G1 cell cycle phase when stimulated in vitro . Importantly , nucleoprotein extracts showing decreased DNA - binding activity had normal amounts of Oct - 1 proteins as determined by immunoprecipitation , implying a functional defect in the Oct - 1 protein . Moreover , defective DNA binding was corrected by treatment with acid phosphatase . The cyclosporin A ( CsA ) / FK506 - sensitive nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) plays a key role in the inducible expression of cytokine genes in T cells . Although NFAT has been recently shown to be inducible in several non - T immune cells , the NFAT gene family members characterized to date have been isolated only from T cells . To further characterize NFAT function in human B cells and to demonstrate cytokine gene specificity of NFAT proteins , we report here the isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone from the Raji B cell line . The cDNA clone encodes a new isoform , NFATc . beta , of the NFAT gene family member NFATc ( designated here NFATc . alpha ) . alpha in the first NH2 - terminal 29 residues and contains an additional region of 142 residues at the COOH terminus . Northern analysis using a probe encompassing a common region of both isoforms showed two mRNA species of 2 . 7 and 4 . 5 kilobase pairs , while an NFATc . beta - specific probe detected only the 4 . 5 - kilobase pair mRNA which was preferentially expressed in the spleen . These data suggest that different members or isoforms of NFAT gene family may regulate inducible expression of different cytokine genes . Regulation of interferon - gamma gene expression . Interferon - gamma ( IFN - gamma ) , also known as type II interferon , is an important immunoregulatory gene that has multiple effects on the development , maturation , and function of the immune system . IFN - gamma mRNA and protein are expressed predominantly by T cells and large granular lymphocytes . The IFN - gamma mRNA is induced / inhibited in these cell types by a wide variety of extracellular signals , thus implicating a number of diverse , yet convergent signal transduction pathways in its transcriptional control . In this review , I describe how DNA methylation and specific DNA binding proteins may regulate transcription of the IFN - gamma gene in response to extracellular signals . Transcriptional analysis of Epstein - Barr virus gene expression in EBV - positive gastric carcinoma : unique viral latency in the tumour cells . Although case - oriented evidence for an association of Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) with gastric carcinoma has been accumulating recently , the interaction ( s ) between EBV and gastric epithelial cells is / are largely unknown . Reverse transcription - PCR analysis showed that all seven EBV - positive tumour tissues constitutively expressed EBV nuclear antigen ( EBNA ) 1 mRNA , but not EBNA2 mRNA . The EBNA transcription was initiated from one of three EBNA promoters , Qp : by contrast , both Cp and Wp were silent , thus resulting in the lack of EBNA2 mRNA . Latent membrane protein ( LMP ) 2A mRNA was detected in three of seven cases ; however , neither LMP1 nor LMP2B mRNA was detected in any of the tumours tested . Transcripts from the BamHI - A region of the viral genome were detectable in all cases . BZLF1 mRNA and the product , an immediate - early gene for EBV replication , was not expressed in any of them , thereby suggesting that the tumour cells carried EBV genomes in a tightly latent form . These findings further extended our previous data regarding EBV latency in gastric carcinoma cells at the protein level , and have affirmed that the programme of viral gene expression in the tumour more closely resembles ' latency I ' represented by Burkitt ' s lymphoma than ' latency II ' represented by the majority of nasopharyngeal carcinomas . Characterization of Grb2 - binding proteins in human platelets activated by Fc gamma RIIA cross - linking . Glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) - Grb2 fusion proteins have been used to identify the potential role of Grb2 - binding proteins in platelet activation by the platelet low - affinity IgG receptor , Fc gamma RIIA . Two tyrosine phosphoproteins of 38 and 63 kD bind to the SH2 domain of Grb2 following Fc gamma RIIA stimulation of platelets . p38 also forms a complex with the tyrosine kinase csk in stimulated cells and is a substrate for the kinase . The SH3 domains of Grb2 form a stable complex with SOS1 and two proteins of 75 kD and 120 kD , which undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in Fc gamma RIIA stimulated cells . The 75 - kD protein is recognized by antibodies to SLP - 76 , which has recently been isolated from T cells and sequenced . Tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 and p63 is also observed in platelets stimulated by the tyrosine kinase - linked receptor agonist collagen and by the G protein - coupled receptor agonist thrombin , although phosphorylation of SLP - 76 is only observed in collagen - stimulated platelets . p38 and p63 may provide a docking site for Grb2 , thereby linking Grb2 SH3 - binding proteins SOS1 , SLP - 76 , and p120 to downstream signalling events . The activated form of the interferon - induced transcription factor complex ISGF3 was also detected in nuclear extracts from uninduced cells . Culture supernatants from uninduced U937 cells were also found to activate an ISRE cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene , indicating the presence of endogenous IFN activity equivalent to approximately 0 . 3 to 0 . 5 IU / mL . This endogenous IFN was also shown to play a role in maintaining the basal level of expression of the major histocompatibility class I genes in lymphoid cells . An IL - 2 response element in the human IL - 2 receptor alpha chain promoter is a composite element that binds Stat5 , Elf - 1 , HMG - I ( Y ) and a GATA family protein . Expression of the human interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) receptor alpha chain gene is potently upregulated by its own ligand , IL - 2 . In this study , we characterize an essential upstream IL - 2 response element that contains both consensus and non - consensus GAS motifs , two putative Ets binding sites ( EBS ) , one of which overlaps the consensus GAS motif , and a GATA motif , which overlaps the non - consensus GAS motif . We demonstrate that although the individual components of this element do not respond to IL - 2 , together they form a composite element capable of conferring IL - 2 responsiveness to a heterologous promoter . Multiple factors including Stat5 , Elf - 1 , HMG - I ( Y ) and GATA family proteins bind to the IL - 2 response element and mutation of any one of these binding sites diminishes the activity of this element . An unidentified Ets family protein binds to the EBS overlapping the consensus GAS motif and appears to negatively regulate the human IL - 2R alpha promoter . Deranged cellular cholesterol homeostasis has been widely recognized in the initiation as well as progression of various types of cancers including chronic myeloid leukaemia ( CML ) . Since the human genomic sterol regulatory element ( SRE ) has been shown to regulate various key genes involved in this phenomenon , the present study revealed the existence of a unique 47 kDa protein factor having affinity for this SRE sequence in lymphocytes from normal subjects , as well as its absence in lymphocytes from untreated CML patients . However , this factor appeared when these CML patients achieved complete haematological remission ( CHR ) through alpha - interferon therapy . Furthermore , an inverse relationship was also observed between the LDL receptor gene expression at the transcriptional level and the binding affinity of this 47 kDa protein factor to the SRE sequence . Based upon these results we propose that this factor may have a role in pathophysiology of chronic myeloid leukaemia . Cloning and characterization of the beta subunit of human proximal sequence element - binding transcription factor and its involvement in transcription of small nuclear RNA genes by RNA polymerases II and III . We previously reported the purification of human PTF , a complex of four subunits , and the molecular cloning and characterization of PTF gamma and delta subunits . Native PTF beta , in either protein fractions or a PTF - Oct - 1 - DNA complex , can be recognized by polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant PTF beta . Immunodepletion studies show that PTF beta is required for transcription of both classes of snRNA genes in vitro . In addition , immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrate that substantial and similar molar amounts of TATA - binding protein ( TBP ) and TFIIIB90 can weakly associate with PTF at low salt conditions , but this association is dramatically reduced at high salt concentrations . Along with our previous demonstration of both physical interactions between PTF gamma / PTF delta and TBP and the involvement of TFIIIB90 in the transcription of class III snRNA genes , these results are consistent with the notion that a TBP - containing complex related to TFIIIB is required for the transcription of class III snRNA genes , and acts through weak interaction with the four - subunit PTF . Attenuated function of a variant form of the helix - loop - helix protein , Id - 3 , generated by an alternative splicing mechanism . The Id family of helix - loop - helix proteins function as negative regulators of DNA binding , basic helix - loop - helix proteins in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation . Northern analysis revealed expression of a minor 1 . 1 kb Id - 3L transcript together with the predominant 0 . 95 kb Id - 3 transcript in the majority of adult human tissues analysed . The variant Id - 3L protein is functionally distinguishable from conventional Id - 3 since in in vitro DNA mobility shift assays , it was greatly impaired in its ability to abrogate binding of the basic helix - loop - helix protein , E47 , to an E box recognition sequence . Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) patients develop progressive cytokine - mediated inflammatory lung disease , with abundant production of thick , tenacious , protease - and oxidant - rich purulent airway secretions that are difficult to clear even with physiotherapy . We have previously shown that tyloxapol is a potent antioxidant for hydroxyl radicals ( OH ) . Tyloxapol ( 0 . 05 to 0 . 1 % wt / vol ) effectively scavenges the oxidant hypochlorous acid ( HOCl ; 1 to 7 . 5 mM ) in vitro , and protects from HOCl - mediated lung injury in rats . Tyloxapol also reduces the viscosity of CF sputum ( from 463 + / - 133 to 128 + / - 52 centipoise ) . We conclude that tyloxapol is potentially useful as a new antiinflammatory therapy for CF lung disease , and could possibly promote clearance of secretions in the CF airway . Elevated cyclic AMP inhibits NF - kappaB - mediated transcription in human monocytic cells and endothelial cells . The NF - kappaB / Rel family of transcription factors regulates the inducible expression of many genes in activated human monocytes and endothelial cells . Both forskolin and dibutyryl cAMP , which elevate intracellular cAMP by independent mechanisms , inhibited TNFalpha and tissue factor expression at the level of transcription . Induction of NF - kappaB - dependent gene expression in transiently transfected human monocytic THP - 1 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells was inhibited by elevated cAMP and by overexpression of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A ( PKA ) . Elevated cAMP did not prevent nuclear translocation of p50 / p65 and c - Rel / p65 heterodimers , decrease nuclear translocation of p65 , or significantly modify TNFalpha - induced phosphorylation of p65 . Functional studies demonstrated that transcriptional activation of a plasmid containing multimerized kappaB sites by p65 was inhibited by agents that elevate cAMP and by overexpression of the catalytic subunit of PKA . This study indicates that activation of PKA reduces the induction of a distinct set of genes in monocytes and endothelial cells by inhibiting NF - kappaB - mediated transcription . Molecular mechanisms of steroid action : a novel type of cross - talk between glucocorticoids and NF - kappa B transcription factors . Despite the widespread use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of diseases characterized by inflammation , the molecular mechanism ( s ) by which these hormones exert this beneficial effect in patients with asthma remains to be elucidated . Therefore , we have studied the transcriptional regulation of intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 ( ICAM - 1 ) as adhesion molecules are likely to play a causal role in inflammation in promoting cell - cell and cell - matrix interactions . We observed that in a monocytic ( U937 ) and a bronchial epithelial ( H292 ) cell - line dexamethasone strongly suppressed basal and induced ICAM - 1 expression . Subsequent analysis of the human ICAM - 1 promoter has revealed that both 12 - O - tetradecanoylphorbol 13 - acetate ( TPA ) and tumour necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF - alpha ) upregulate ICAM - 1 expression through the presence of a nuclear factor ( NF - kappa B ) target sequence ( TGGAAATTCC ) . No glucocorticoid recognition sequences are present in this promoter region and dexamethasone is still able to repress transcription when the multimerized NF - kappa B sequence is transactivated by TNF - alpha upon transfection in 293 cells . Abnormalities of p16 , p15 and CDK4 genes in recurrent malignant astrocytomas . The results of the present study demonstrate that dysfunction of these genes also occurs during recurrence of glial tumors that were highly malignant at first presentation . Analysis of 10 matched pairs of high grade malignant astrocytomas and their subsequent recurrences identified three distinct groups . Upon recurrence , however , the tumors sustained either deletion of p16 alone or codeletion of both p16 and p15 or amplification of CDK4 . Analysis of the molecular differences between primary anaplastic astrocytomas / glioblastomas and their subsequent recurrences , which are clinically indistinguishable , may provide better therapeutic options for treatment . BCL - 6 , a POZ / zinc - finger protein , is a sequence - specific transcriptional repressor . The BCL6 gene encodes a 95 - kDa protein containing six C - terminal zinc - finger motifs and an N - terminal POZ domain , suggesting that it may function as a transcription factor . By using a DNA sequence selected for its ability to bind recombinant BCL - 6 in vitro , we show here that BCL - 6 is present in DNA - binding complexes in nuclear extracts from various B - cell lines . We demonstrate that this part of the BCL6 molecule contains an autonomous transrepressor domain and that two noncontiguous regions , including the POZ motif , mediate maximum transrepressive activity . These results indicate that the BCL - 6 protein can function as a sequence - specific transcriptional repressor and have implications for the role of BCL6 in normal lymphoid development and lymphomagenesis . Signals leading to the activation of NF - kappa B transcription factor are stronger in neonatal than adult T lymphocytes . The molecular background of the defects in the immune reactivity of human neonates has not been fully elucidated . The activity was tested by quantitating the nuclear proteins binding to an oligonucleotide containing the consensus kappa B binding sequence ( electrophoretic mobility shift assay ) . The data obtained demonstrate that phorbol dibutyrate / calcium ionophore A23187 ( PDBu / iono ) combination induced a clearly higher nuclear translocation of NF - kappa B in neonatal than adult T cells . This higher NF - kappa B activity was restricted to the CD4 + T - cell subset . Analysis of the nuclear extracts with antibodies directed against the major components of NF - kappa B the p50 and RelA ( p65 ) proteins , indicated that the composition of NF - kappa B was similar in neonatal and adult cells . These results suggest that neonatal T cells are exposed to oxidative stress - inducing signals during delivery and / or are inherently more sensitive to NF - kappa B activating signals than adult T cells . Dual action of retinoic acid on human embryonic / fetal hematopoiesis : blockade of primitive progenitor proliferation and shift from multipotent / erythroid / monocytic to granulocytic differentiation program . In preliminary studies , we have analyzed the hematopoietic growth factor ( HGF ) requirement of hematopoietic progenitor cells ( HPCs ) purified from embryonic - fetal liver ( FL ) and grown in fetal calf serum - supplemented ( FCS + ) clonogenic culture . Furthermore , in the absence of exogenous HGFs , FL monocytic progenitors ( colony - forming unit monocyte [ CFU - M ] ) generate large colonies exclusively composed of monocytes - macrophages ; these colonies are absent in FCS - clonogenic culture . On this basis , we have investigated the role of all - trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) and its isomer 9 - cis RA in FL hematopoiesis . Both compounds modulate the growth of purified FL HPCs , which show a dose - dependent shift from mixed / erythroid / monocytic to granulocytic colony formation . Studies on unicellular and paired daughter cell culture unequivocally indicate that the shift is mediated by modulation of the HPC differentiation program to the granulopoietic pathway ( rather than RA - induced down - modulation of multipotent / erythroid / monocytic HPC growth coupled with recruitment of granulocytic HPCs ) . ATRA and 9 - cis RA also exert their effect on the proliferation of primitive HPCs ( high - proliferative potential colony - forming cells [ HPP - CFCs ] ) and putative hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ; assayed in Dexter - type long - term culture ) . It is crucial that these results mirror recent observations indicating that murine adult HPCs transduced with dominant negative ATRA receptor ( RAR ) gene are immortalized and show a selective blockade of granulocytic differentiation . Dexamethasone suppression test : corticosteroid receptors regulation in mononuclear leukocytes of young and aged subjects . The dexamethasone suppression test ( DST ) is considered an indicator of the function of the adrenal pituitary axis . The effect of the steroid is mediated by its binding to corticosteroid receptors . In the present study , corticosteroid Type I and Type II receptors in mononuclear leukocytes were measured in 10 elderly subjects and in 9 young adults , before and after overnight DST ( 1 mg ) . In all the subjects , dexamethasone was able to suppress plasma cortisol . The number of Type I and Type II receptors before the test was lower in elderly subjects than in adults . In the control group , dexamethasone produced a significant depression of Type I receptors ( from 267 + / - 72 to 169 + / - 71 receptors per cell ) , which can be interpreted as a primary involvement of Type I receptors in the response to dexamethasone ; Type II receptors decreased in half the subjects ( from 2849 + / - 703 to 2345 + / - 569 receptors per cell ) . In elderly healthy subjects , Type II receptors were also significantly decreased ( from 1796 + / - 671 to 720 + / - 345 ) . We suggest that in young subjects Type II receptors are initially up - regulated by dexamethasone , and then down - regulated , while in aged subjects an up - regulation can not be achieved , as suggested by the higher values of plasma cortisol usually found in aging subjects . They are composed of different structural domains , including distinct domains for DNA and ligand binding . In this study , we examined the functional role of cysteine and arginine residues in the ligand - binding domain of hRAR alpha ( hRAR alpha - LBD , amino acids 154 to 462 ) . All conserved cysteine and arginine residues in this domain were mutated by site - directed mutagenesis , and the mutant proteins were characterized by blocking reactions , ligand - binding experiments , transactivation assays , and protease mapping . Changes of any cysteine residue of the hRAR alpha - LBD had no significant influence on the binding of all - trans RA or 9 - cis RA . In addition , antagonists show distinctly different requirements for efficient binding , which may contribute to their interference in the ligand - inducible transactivation function of RAR alpha . IL4 and IL13 receptors share the gamma c chain and activate STAT6 , STAT3 and STAT5 proteins in normal human B cells . IL13 induces the same biological effects as IL4 in normal human B cells . We show that as in the IL4R complex , both IL4R alpha and IL2R gamma c are components of the IL13R and that both cytokines induced STAT6 , STAT3 and STAT5 activation in B cells . Calcineurin mutants render T lymphocytes resistant to cyclosporin A . The immunosuppressants cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 have been widely used to prevent and treat graft rejection after human organ and tissue transplantations . CsA and FK506 associate with intracellular binding proteins ( i . e . , CsA with cyclophilin A and FK506 with FKBP12 ) to form protein / drug complexes that suppress the immune system by preventing activation of T cells in response to antigen presentation . The common target of CsA and FK506 is calcineurin , a Ca2 + / calmodulin - regulated , serine / threonine - specific protein phosphatase that regulates the nuclear import of a transcription factor , NF - AT , required for expression of T cell activation genes . In previous studies , we identified calcineurin mutations that block binding by the cyclophilin A / CsA or FKBP12 / FK506 complexes and thereby render yeast cells resistant to the antifungal effects of CsA or FK506 . In this report , we demonstrate that the corresponding mutations in murine calcineurin render the T cell receptor signal transduction cascade CsA resistant in human Jurkat T cells . Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) , the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis , is a human herpesvirus associated with epithelial cell malignancies ( nasopharyngeal carcinoma ) as well as B - cell malignancies . Understanding how viral latency is disrupted is a central issue in herpesvirus biology . It is known that expression of a single viral immediate - early protein , BZLF1 , is sufficient to initiate the switch from latent to lytic infection in B cells . Cellular regulation of BZLF1 transcription is therefore thought to play a key role in regulating the stringency of viral latency . Here we show that , unexpectedly , expression of another viral immediate - early protein , BRLF1 , can disrupt viral latency in an epithelial cell - specific fashion . Therefore , the mechanisms leading to disruption of EBV latency appear to be cell - type specific . Eosinophil priming by cytokines : from cellular signal to in vivo modulation . This review will focus on the conversion of the unprimed eosinophil phenotype in the peripheral blood of normal individuals to the primed phenotype found in the peripheral blood and tissues of allergic patients , a phenomenon called priming . Recent data on the signals initiated after cytokine receptor activation on eosinophils will be reviewed . CTL recognition of an altered peptide associated with asparagine bond rearrangement . Implications for immunity and vaccine design . We report on the CTL recognition of a MHC class I - restricted peptide containing a cyclized asparagine ( succinimide ) residue . This modification of the asparagine side chain is a common intermediate structure during deamidation , isomerization , and bond rearrangements of amide - containing amino acids and also occurs as a side reaction in peptide synthesis . Similarly , CTL raised against the parent peptide did not recognize the succinimide derivative of this peptide . Naturally processed forms of these structures are likely to occur given the importance and frequency of deamidation both in vitro and in vivo . In addition , unwanted and potentially hazardous specificities may be elicited when using synthetic peptides in subunit vaccines in which succinimide residues may form spontaneously during storage or chemical synthesis . XPB is a subunit of the basal transcription factor TFIIH , which is also involved in nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) and potentially in cell cycle regulation . A frameshift mutation in the 3 ' - end of the XPB gene is responsible for a concurrence of two disorders : xeroderma pigmentosum ( XP ) and Cockayne ' s syndrome ( CS ) . We have isolated TFIIH from cells derived from a patient ( XP11BE ) who carries this frameshift mutation ( TFIIHmut ) and from the mother of this patient ( TFIIHwt ) to determine the biochemical consequences of the mutation . A decrease in helicase and DNA - dependent ATPase activities was also observed with the mutated recombinant XPB protein . In addition , we provide evidence for a decrease in basal transcription activity in vitro . Thus , this work presents the first detailed analysis of a naturally occurring mutation in a basal transcription factor and supports the concept that the combined XP / CS clinical entity is actually the result of a combined transcription / repair deficiency . The Ets protein Spi - B is expressed exclusively in B cells and T cells during development . Spi - B and PU . 1 are hematopoietic - specific transcription factors that constitute a subfamily of the Ets family of DNA - binding proteins . Here we show that contrary to previous reports , PU . 1 and Spi - B have very different expression patterns . PU . 1 is expressed at high levels in B cells , mast cells , megakaryocytes , macrophages , neutrophils , and immature erythroid cells and at lower levels in mature erythrocytes . In situ hybridizations of adult murine tissues demonstrate Spi - B mRNA in the medulla of the thymus , the white pulp of the spleen , and the germinal centers of lymph nodes . Spi - B expression is very abundant in B cells and both Spi - B mRNA and protein are detected in some T cells . Gel - retardation experiments show that Spi - B can bind to all putative PU . 1 binding sites , but do not reveal any preferred Spi - B binding site . Finally , both PU . 1 and Spi - B function as transcriptional activators of the immunoglobulin light - chain enhancer E lambda 2 . 4 when coexpressed with Pip ( PU . 1 - interaction partner ) in NIH - 3T3 cells . A critical role of Sp1 - and Ets - related transcription factors in maintaining CTL - specific expression of the mouse perforin gene . This study was designed to determine the potential cis - elements involved in transcriptional regulation of the mouse perforin gene . The six 5 ' upstream and one intronic DHS were detected in only perforin - expressing lymphocytes . A construct termed PFP5a containing - 795 bp exhibited the highest CAT activity , and PFP9a20 containing only - 73 bp also produced significantly high CAT activity in CTLL - R8 cells . The proximal region in PFP9a20 contained two potential Sp1 binding sites ( GC box and GT box ) and one Ets binding site ( EBS ) . Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that each of the cis - elements bound specific protein factors . To confirm the importance of the three cis - acting elements in the perforin gene expression , point mutation was introduced again to each proximal GC box , EBS , and GT box of PFP5a . The point mutations resulted in a 2 . 5 - to 3 - fold reduction of CAT activity . The Oct - 2 transcription factor . The Oct - 2 transcription factor is a member of the POU ( Pit - Oct - Unc ) family of transcription factors and is expressed only in B lymphocytes and in neuronal cells but not in other cell types . The primary RNA transcript of the gene is subject to alternative splicing to yield different variants which can either activate or repress gene expression . The forms produced in B lymphocytes have a predominantly activating effect on gene expression whereas those produced in neuronal cells have a predominantly inhibitory effect and can repress the expression of both the herpes simplex virus immediate - early genes and the cellular tyrosine hydroxylase gene . Cell - type - specific regulation of the human tumor necrosis factor alpha gene in B cells and T cells by NFATp and ATF - 2 / JUN . The human tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - alpha ) gene is one of the earliest genes transcribed after the stimulation of a B cell through its antigen receptor or via the CD - 40 pathway . In both cases , induction of TNF - alpha gene transcription can be blocked by the immunosuppressants cyclosporin A and FK506 , which suggested a role for the NFAT family of proteins in the regulation of the gene in B cells . Furthermore , in T cells , two molecules of NFATp bind to the TNF - alpha promoter element kappa 3 in association with ATF - 2 and Jun proteins bound to an immediately adjacent cyclic AMP response element ( CRE ) site . Here , using the murine B - cell lymphoma cell line A20 , we show that the TNF - alpha gene is regulated in a cell - type - specific manner . In A20 B cells , the TNF - alpha gene is not regulated by NFATp bound to the kappa 3 element . This new site plays a critical role in the calcium - mediated , cyclosporin A - sensitive induction of TNF - alpha in both A20 B cells and Ar - 5 cells . Two other previously unrecognized NFATp - binding sites in the proximal TNF - alpha promoter were also identified by this analysis . Activation of Stat 5b in erythroid progenitors correlates with the ability of ErbB to induce sustained cell proliferation . Self renewal of normal erythroid progenitors is induced by the receptor tyrosine kinase c - ErbB , whereas other receptors ( c - Kit / Epo - R ) regulate erythroid differentiation . Activation of the erythropoietin receptor caused specific DNA - binding of Stat 5b , but failed to induce reporter gene transcription . These biochemical findings correlate perfectly with the selective ability of c - ErbB to cause sustained self renewal in erythroid progenitors . Defective transcription of the IL - 2 gene is associated with impaired expression of c - Fos , FosB , and JunB in anergic T helper 1 cells . Anergic CD4 + Th cells do not produce IL - 2 when challenged with Ag - pulsed accessory cells because of a transcriptional defect . In this work , we report that these anergic T cells are defective in their ability to up - regulate protein binding and transactivation at two critical IL - 2 DNA enhancer elements : NF - AT ( nuclear factor of activated T cells ; a sequence that binds a heterotrimeric NFATp , Fos , and Jun protein complex ) and Activator Protein - 1 ( AP - 1 ) ( that binds Fos and Jun heterodimers ) . Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts showed that the impaired DNA - protein interactions in anergic T cells were associated with poor expression of the inducible AP - 1 family members c - Fos , FosB , and JunB . However , the reduced expression of these proteins was not the result of a global TCR / CD3 - signaling defect because CD3 cross - linking induced an equivalent increase in intracellular - free calcium ions , as well as NFATp dephosphorylation , translocation to the nucleus , and DNA binding in both normal and anergic T cells . Thus , defective IL - 2 gene transcription appears to be due , at least in part , to a selective block in the expression of the AP - 1 Fos and Jun family members in anergic T cells . B - cell - specific transcription of immunoglobulin genes is mediated by the interaction of a POU domain containing transcription factor Oct - 1 or Oct - 2 , with the B - cell - specific coactivator OCA - B ( Bob - 1 , OBF - 1 ) and a prototype octamer element . We find that OCA - B binds DNA directly in the major groove between the two subdomains of the POU domain , requiring both an A at the fifth position of the octamer element and contact with the POU domain . An amino - terminal fragment of OCA - B binds the octamer site in the absence of a POU domain with the same sequence specificity . Coactivator OCA - B may undergo a POU - dependent conformational change that exposes its amino terminus , allowing it to recognize specific DNA sequences in the major groove within the binding site for Oct - 1 or Oct - 2 . The recognition of both the POU domain and the octamer sequence by OCA - B provides a mechanism for differential regulation of octamer sites containing genes by the ubiquitous factor Oct - 1 . Uneven X inactivation in a female monozygotic twin pair with Fabry disease and discordant expression of a novel mutation in the alpha - galactosidase A gene . We describe two female monozygotic ( MZ ) twins heterozygous for Fabry disease , an X linked disorder resulting from the deficient activity of alpha - galactosidase A . Enzymatic assay of alpha - galactosidase in blood leucocytes , skin fibroblasts , Epstein - Barr virus transformed lymphoid cell lines , and hair follicles of the twins and their parents confirmed the heterozygous status of the twins and indicated that Fabry disease had occurred as a result of a de novo mutation . The son of the unaffected twin sister was shown to be hemizygous . Molecular analysis of the alpha - galactosidase A gene permitted the identification of an as yet undescribed point mutation at position 10182 of exon 5 which causes an Asp to Asn substitution at codon 231 . Single strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) analysis again showed the heterozygous status of the twins and a normal pattern in their parents . The basis for the discordant expression of this d novo mutation in the twins was investigated by studying their X inactivation status . Analysis of the inactive X specific methylation at the androgen receptor gene showed unbalanced inactivation in the twins ' fibroblasts and in opposite directions . While the maternally derived X chromosome was preferentially active in the asymptomatic twin , the paternal X chromosome was active in the other , affected twin and was found in her hemizygotic nephew . These data suggest that the paternal X chromosome carries the de novo alpha - galactosidase A mutation and that uneven X inactivation is the underlying mechanism for disease expression in this novel female MZ twin pair . We tested the necessity for appropriate spatial alignment of these elements by using mutated enhancers with altered spacings . A 4 - or 10 - bp insertion between muE3 and muB inactivated the mu enhancer in S194 plasma cells but did not affect in vitro binding of Ets - 1 , PU . 1 , or the muE3 - binding protein TFE3 , alone or in pairwise combinations . Circular permutation and phasing analyses demonstrated that PU . 1 binding but not TFE3 or Ets - 1 bends mu enhancer DNA toward the major groove . We propose that the requirement for precise spacing of the muA and muB elements is due in part to a directed DNA bend induced by PU . 1 . [ Cortisone - resistant bronchial asthma ] There is general agreement on the inflammatory pathogenesis of bronchial asthma : an accumulation of activated eosinophils , degranulated mast cells , T lymphocytes and in very severe forms , granulocytes has constantly been found in the bronchial mucosa . Although corticosteroids are the most potent therapeutic agents used for this disease , their anti - inflammatory effect differs from patient to patient . This review analyzes various molecular alterations responsible for the deficient response to corticosteroid treatment observed in steroid - resistant bronchial asthmatic subjects . New knowledge on the mechanism of steroid resistance may have important implications for the treatment of chronic asthma and other diseases . We have defined the mechanisms of transactivation by NFAT1 . NFAT1 possesses two transactivation domains whose sequences are not conserved in the other NFAT - family proteins , and a conserved DNA - binding domain that mediates the recruitment of cooperating nuclear transcription factors even when it is expressed in the absence of other regions of the protein . The activity of the NH2 - terminal transactivation domain is modulated by an adjacent regulatory region that contains several conserved sequence motifs represented only in the NFAT family . Induction of activator protein ( AP ) - 1 and nuclear factor - kappaB by CD28 stimulation involves both phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase and acidic sphingomyelinase signals . To overcome this problem , we have exploited the observation that activated human T cell blasts can be stimulated via the CD28 surface molecule in the absence of antigenic challenge ; thus , we have been able to observe the response of normal T cells to CD28 activation in isolation . Using this system , we observed that CD28 stimulation by B7 - transfected CHO cells induced a proliferative response in T cells that was not accompanied by measurable IL - 2 production . However , subsequent analysis of transcription factor generation revealed that B7 stimulation induced both activator protein - 1 ( AP - 1 ) and nuclear factor - kappaB ( NF - kappaB ) complexes , but not NF - AT . In contrast , engagement of the TCR by class II MHC / superantigen , either with or without CD28 ligation , resulted in the induction of NF - AT , AP - 1 , and NF - kappaB as well as IL - 2 production . Using selective inhibitors , we investigated the signaling pathways involved in the CD28 - mediated induction of AP - 1 and NF - kappaB . In contrast , AP - 1 generation was inhibited by wortmannin and was also variably sensitive to chloroquine . These data suggest that in activated normal T cells , CD28 - derived signals can stimulate proliferation at least in part via NF - kappaB and AP - 1 generation , and that this response uses both acidic sphingomyelinase and phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase - linked pathways . Presence of a variant form of the estrogen receptor in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal individuals and lupus patients . Estrogen may participate in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) via its intracellular receptor . Using RT - PCR we were able to identify both the full length wild - type form and an isoform of the ER which precisely lacks exon V in both patient and normal individuals . Our results , although limited , suggest that normal individuals can express both the wild - type and truncated version at the same time , whereas lupus patients only express either the wild - type or the truncated ER . This finding may lead to a better understanding of the reasons for the prevalence of lupus in females and of the estrogenic effects on SLE disease activity . Regulation of sialoadhesin expression on rat macrophages . Induction by glucocorticoids and enhancement by IFN - beta , IFN - gamma , IL - 4 , and lipopolysaccharide . Sialoadhesin is a macrophage - restricted member of the Ig superfamily that mediates adhesion with lymphoid and myeloid cells . We have studied the regulation of sialoadhesin expression in vitro and show that glucocorticoids ( GC ) induce sialoadhesin expression on freshly isolated rat macrophages and the rat macrophage cell line R2 . The cytokines IFN - beta , IFN - gamma , IL - 4 , and LPS , although unable to induce sialoadhesin expression by themselves , were able to enhance GC - mediated induction of sialoadhesin . Comparison of the different combinations of GC and cytokines / LPS revealed differences in the level of GC - dependent enhancement of sialoadhesin expression , with IFN - beta and IL - 4 being more potent than IFN - gamma and LPS . Moreover , the effects of IFN - gamma and LPS could be reproduced by priming , whereas IFN - beta and IL - 4 were required simultaneously with GC . The regulation of sialoadhesin expression was mediated by the GC receptor , and not by mineralocorticoid receptor , as shown by inhibition experiments with specific antagonists . Finally , it is demonstrated that macrophages in the adrenal gland , the major site of endogenous GC production , express sialoadhesin . This study demonstrates that GC act as a primary inducer of sialoadhesin expression on rat macrophages , and that the response can be enhanced by IFN - beta , T cell - derived cytokines , or LPS . Apoptosis mediated by HIV protease is preceded by cleavage of Bcl - 2 . Expression of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV ) protease in cultured cells leads to apoptosis , preceded by cleavage of bcl - 2 , a key negative regulator of cell death . In contrast , a high level of bcl - 2 protects cells in vitro and in vivo from the viral protease and prevents cell death following HIV infection of human lymphocytes , while reducing the yields of viral structural proteins , infectivity , and tumor necrosis factor alpha . We present a model for HIV replication in which the viral protease depletes the infected cells of bcl - 2 , leading to oxidative stress - dependent activation of NF kappa B , a cellular factor required for HIV transcription , and ultimately to cell death . Purified bcl - 2 is cleaved by HIV protease between phenylalanine 112 and alanine 113 . Alpha 4 beta 1 ( CD49d / CD29 ) integrin costimulation of human T cells enhances transcription factor and cytokine induction in the absence of altered sensitivity to anti - CD3 stimulation . The integrin alpha 4 beta 1 can provide a costimulus to induce IL - 2 secretion and IL - 2R expression leading to enhanced proliferation of purified , peripheral blood T cells . Similar to expression of IL - 2 , we demonstrated that recombinant vascular - cell adhesion molecule - 1 , when co - immobilized with anti - CD3 mAb , significantly enhanced the induction of transcription factors NF - AT , AP - 1 , and NF - kappa B as determined by electromobility shift assays . alpha 4 beta 1 ligation alone had no effect on transcription factor binding . The requirements for induction of transcription factors reflected the requirements for the secretion of multiple cytokines , including IL - 2 , TNF - alpha , IFN - gamma , and granulocyte macrophage - CSF . Comparison of the dose response to anti - CD3 stimulation demonstrated that half - maximal induction of IL - 2 was achieved using the same dose of anti - CD3 for both freshly isolated and cultured T cells . Furthermore , the dose of OKT3 required to achieve half - maximal activation was the same using PMA or different concentrations of alpha 4 beta 1 ligands . Therefore , costimulation by alpha 4 beta 1 ligands was not due to stabilization of the interaction of the cells with its substrate . We conclude , rather , that alpha 4 beta 1 in freshly isolated T cells delivers a distinct signal that synergizes early with signals initiated by TCR / CD3 ligation to induce DNA binding of multiple transcription factors required for cytokine gene induction . Inhibition of T lymphocyte activation by cAMP is associated with down - regulation of two parallel mitogen - activated protein kinase pathways , the extracellular signal - related kinase and c - Jun N - terminal kinase . These pathways are disrupted by agonists that utilize adenylate cyclase and cAMP - dependent protein kinase A ( PKA ) . We found that the adenylate cyclase activator , forskolin , inhibits anti - CD3 - induced shift in Lck electrophoretic mobility , suggesting an intervention at the TCR - coupled phosphoinositide turnover that precedes the activation of PKC . The shift of Lck following direct PKC activation by 12 - O - tetradecanoyl phorbol 13 - acetate , which bypasses early receptor - triggered biochemical events , is insensitive to forskolin . Nevertheless , forskolin also inhibits PKC downstream events , such as c - jun expression , which is critical for the activation process of T cells . To further analyze potential cross points between positively and negatively regulating signaling pathways in T cells , we tested the effects of activators of the adenylate cyclase or PKA on two parallel mitogen - activated protein kinase signaling pathways mediated by extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) and c - Jun N - terminal kinase . Using a PKC - specific inhibitor , GF109203X , or PKC - depleted T cells , we found that a large part of the anti - CD3 - induced ERK activation is PKC dependent . Both PKC - dependent and - independent activation of ERK were sensitive to inhibition by forskolin or a cell - permeable cAMP analogue , dbcAMP . Furthermore , the effect of 12 - O - tetradecanoyl phorbol 13 - acetate and ionomycin , which synergized to fully activate c - Jun N - terminal kinase , was also sensitive to inhibition by forskolin . Transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of erythroid gene expression in anthracycline - induced differentiation of human erythroleukemic cells . Aclacinomycin ( ACLA ) and doxorubicin ( DOX ) were used at subtoxic concentrations to induce erythroid differentiation in the human leukemic cell line K562 . Cell hemoglobinization was accompanied by the increased expression of genes encoding gamma - globin and porphobilinogen deaminase ( PBGD ) , an enzyme of heme synthesis . By using run - on assays , ACLA was shown to induce an enhancement of the transcription of erythroid genes , including gamma - globin , PBGD , erythropoietin receptor , and GATA - 1 transcription factor . In contrast , in DOX - treated cells , the transcription rate of these genes was unchanged in comparison with control cells . In addition , inhibition of mRNA synthesis with actinomycin D indicated that DOX induced an increased stability of PBGD and GATA - 1 mRNAs , whereas ACLA did not affect the half - lives of these mRNAs . Because the increase in erythroid mRNA steady - state level in anthracycline - treated cells was inhibited by cycloheximide , this suggests that transcriptional activation in ACLA - treated cells and mRNA stabilization in DOX - treated cells were dependent on de novo protein synthesis . Finally , GATA - 1 protein level was shown to be increased in ACLA - treated but not in DOX - treated cells . These two anthracyclines , although closely related in their structures , appeared to act as differentiation inducers by distinct mechanisms . Indeed , erythroid gene expression was demonstrated to be regulated transcriptionally by ACLA and mainly posttranscriptionall by DOX . Interleukin - 7 signaling in human B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells and murine BAF3 cells involves activation of STAT1 and STAT5 mediated via the interleukin - 7 receptor alpha chain . Interleukin - 7 ( IL - 7 ) stimulates the proliferation of normal and leukemic B and T cell precursors and T lymphocytes . Activation of the JAK / STAT pathway has been implicated in IL - 7R signaling . We investigated which STAT complexes are formed upon stimulation of B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( BCP - ALL ) cells with IL - 7 . Gel retardation assays with STAT - binding oligonucleotides showed that IL - 7 induces the formation of two major STAT complexes in BCP - ALL cells . Supershifts with anti - STAT antibodies identified these as STAT1 and STAT5 complexes . IL - 7 also induced STAT / DNA binding in BCP - ALL cases that failed to proliferate in response to IL - 7 , suggesting that the ability of IL - 7R to activate the JAK / STAT pathway per se is not sufficient for proliferation induction . Activation of the chimeric G - CSF - R / IL - 7R alpha with G - CSF resulted in a full proliferative response and induced the phosphorylation of JAK1 but not JAK2 . Major STAT complexes activated by G - CSF - R / IL - 7R alpha contained STAT1 or STAT5 , while some formation of STAT3 - containing complexes was also seen . These findings establish that STAT1 and STAT5 , and possibly STAT3 , are activated upon stimulation of precursor B cells with IL - 7 . The data further indicate that the IL - 7R alpha chains are directly involved in the activation of JAKs and STATs and have a major role in proliferative signaling in precursor B cells . Stimulation of human lymphocyte proliferation and CD40 antigen expression by phosphorothioate oligonucleotides complementary to hepatitis B virus genome . We have studied the proliferation and CD40 antigen expression of lymphocytes , and the cytotoxicity to monocytes , of antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide complementary to the SP II promoter of HBV mRNA ( sequence I ) and the X gene ( sequence II ) in patients with chronic hepatitis B . The sense sequence ( sequence III ) of the X gene also enhanced the expression of CD40 antigen in patients with hepatitis B . The proportion of CD40 cells ( 26 % ) in a resting B - cell preparation from hepatitis B patients decreased to zero after a 5 - day culture with sequence I , but IgG levels in the culture supernatant increased . The cytotoxic properties of monocytes were not influenced by the oligos . These findings indicate that antisense oligos against hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) have mitogenic effects on the proliferation of human lymphocytes in a non - specific manner and may activate T cells to express CD40 antigen . Activation protein 1 - dependent transcriptional activation of interleukin 2 gene by Ca2 + / calmodulin kinase type IV / Gr . The Ca2 + / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase ( CaMK ) type IV / Gr is selectively expressed in T lymphocytes and is activated after signaling via the T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) , indicating that it mediates some of the Ca ( 2 + ) - dependent transcriptional events that follow TCR engagement . Here we show that CaMKIV / Gr induces the transcription factor activation protein 1 ( AP - 1 ) alone or in synergy with T cell mitogens and with the p21ras oncoprotein . CaMKIV / Gr signaling is associated with transcriptional activation of c - fos but is independent of p21ras or calcineurin . AP - 1 is an integral component of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) transcriptional complex , which is required for interleukin 2 gene expression in T cells . These results reveal a central role for CaMKIV / Gr as a Ca ( 2 + ) - regulated activator of gene transcription in T lymphocytes . IL - 12 - induced activation of NK and T cells occurs in the absence of immediate - early activation gene expression . The responses of lymphocytes to IL - 2 and IL - 12 , involving proliferation , differentiation , and cytokine production , are only partially overlapping , and may depend on induced differential expression of specific sets of genes . Using reverse - transcription PCR differential display , we isolated an mRNA species expressed in IL - 2 - but not IL - 12 - stimulated NK cells . Analysis of the accumulation of mRNA - encoding members of the AP - 1 transcription factor family demonstrated that c - fos and junB are also expressed upon stimulation of NK and T cells with IL - 2 , but not IL - 12 , whereas expression of c - jun and junD is not modified by either cytokine . Accordingly , increased AP - 1 DNA - binding activity and AP - 1 - dependent transcriptional activity were detected exclusively in IL - 2 - stimulated cells . Analysis of the expression of genes reported to regulate cytokine - induced proliferation demonstrated that both IL - 2 and IL - 12 induce c - myc mRNA accumulation in NK and T cells , whereas only IL - 2 induces bcl - 2 expression . Our data provide the first demonstration that IL - 12 - mediated activation of T and NK cells does not involve expression of members of the immediate - early activation genes family ( egr - 1 , c - fos , and junB ) , AP - 1 transcriptional activity , or bcl - 2 expression . This indicates that functional differences observed in IL - 2 - and IL - 12 - stimulated cells may depend , at least in part , on differential gene regulation . Active suppression of the class II transactivator - encoding AIR - 1 locus is responsible for the lack of major histocompatibility complex class II gene expression observed during differentiation from B cells to plasma cells . In this study the genetic control of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II gene expression during the transition from B cell to plasma cell has been analyzed . Class II molecules are not expressed in plasma cells because of an active suppression resulting in the abrogation of class II gene transcription . We show here that the plasma cell - specific repressor function , designated SIR ( suppressor of immune response genes ) , does not act directly on the transcription of class II genes , but instead on the transcription of the AIR - 1 gene , whose product , the class II transactivator ( CIITA ) , is fundamental for the regulation of the constitutive and inducible expression of MHC class II genes . This was unambiguously demonstrated by the fact that plasmacytoma x B cell hybrids carrying an AIR - 1 locus derived from CIITA - expressing cells do not express CIITA - specific transcripts . Transfection of a cDNA containing the human CIITA coding sequence under the control of an heterologous promoter restores expression of human MHC class II genes in the hybrids and is responsible for de novo expression of mouse MHC class II genes in both the mouse plasmacytoma cell line and the hybrids . These results confirm and extend the notion of the functional conservation of the AIR - 1 gene product across species barriers . Interestingly , in CIITA - transfected cell hybrids , cell surface expression of the human HLA - DQ heterodimer was not observed . This result was not attributable to lack of HLA - DQ alpha or - DQ beta transcription , because both transcripts were present in the CIITA - transfected hybrids , although at reduced levels . These findings further support our previous observations on the distinct regulation of expression of the human HLA - DQ class II subset , which may be thus controlled at the posttranscriptional level by a CIITA - independent mechanism . Requirements for induction of vitamin D - mediated gene regulation in normal human B lymphocytes . Mature human lymphocytes are unique targets of 1 alpha , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 alpha , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 ) in that vitamin D receptors ( VDR ) are not constitutively expressed , and specific cellular activation signals are required for both the up - regulation of VDR and establishment of reactivity to the lipophilic ligand . Treatment of B lymphocytes with the cytokine IL - 4 ( IL - 4 ) , in the absence of prior activation , induces a weak up - regulation of VDR expression but fails to generate vitamin D - responsive element ( VDRE ) - reactive nuclear protein complexes or to initiate the genomic transcription of 25 - hydroxyvitamin D3 24 - hydroxylase . Stimulation of B lymphocytes by either ligation of CD40 Ag or cross - linking the Ig receptor is also insufficient to render B lymphocytes responsive to 1 alpha , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 . However , this apparent lack of response to the secosterol can be overcome by stimulation of B lymphocytes with a combination of these cellular activation signals , which are sufficient to lead to G1 cell cycle progression . In the presence of 1 alpha , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 , cellular activation associated with stimulation of such a progression appears to be sufficient for the up - regulation of VDR message and protein and necessary for the establishment of VDRE binding complexes and the induction of 24 - hydroxylase message . Furthermore , biologic functions are modulated , in that the hormone inhibits proliferation in a subset of the activated B cells . These observations suggest that reactivity to 1 alpha , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 is tightly regulated in B lymphocytes , requiring specific signals for its initiation . Cross talk between cell death and cell cycle progression : BCL - 2 regulates NFAT - mediated activation . BCL - 2 - deficient T cells demonstrate accelerated cell cycle progression and increased apoptosis following activation . Proximal signal transduction events and immediate early gene transcription were unaffected . In contrast , a cysteine protease inhibitor that also blocks apoptosis had no substantial affect upon cytokine production . InterleUkin 2 expression requires several transcription factors of which nuclear translocation of NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T cells ) and NFAT - mediated transactivation were impaired by BCL - 2 . Thus , select genetic aberrations in the apoptotic pathway reveal a cell autonomous coregulation of activation . Interaction of the human T - cell lymphotropic virus type 1 tax transactivator with transcription factor IIA . The Tax protein of human T - cell lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV - 1 ) is a 40 - kDa transcriptional activator which is critical for HTLV - 1 gene regulation and virus - induced cellular transformation . Tax is localized to the DNA through its interaction with the site - specific activators cyclic AMP - responsive element - binding protein , NF - kappaB , and serum response factor . It has been suggested that the recruitment of Tax to the DNA positions Tax for interaction with the basal transcriptional machinery . First , Tax was found to interact with the 35 - kDa ( alpha ) subunit of TFIIA in the yeast two - hybrid interaction system . Importantly , two previously characterized mutants with point mutations in Tax , M32 ( Y196A , K197S ) and M41 ( H287A , P288S ) , which were shown to be defective in Tax - activated transcription were unable to interact with TFIIA in this assay . Second , a glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) affinity - binding assay showed that the interaction of holo - TFIIA with GST - Tax was 20 - fold higher than that observed with either the GST - Tax M32 activation mutant or the GST control . Third , a coimmunoprecipitatio assay showed that in HTLV - 1 - infected human T lymphocytes , Tax and TFIIA were associated . In vitro transcription studies showed reduced levels of Tax - activated transcription in cell extracts depleted of TFIIA . In addition , transfection of human T lymphocytes with TFIIA expression vectors enhanced Tax - activated transcription of an HTLV - 1 long terminal repeat - chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct . Our study suggests that the interaction of Tax with the transcription factor TFIIA may play a role in Tax - mediated transcriptional activation . Activation of T cells results in a cascade of gene activation and subsequent proliferation and differentiation into effector phenotypes . The regulation of transcription factors belonging to the signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) family was analyzed in PHA - activated mononuclear cells and in purified T cells activated by cross - linking cell surface CD3 . Cell activation resulted in a delayed induction of STAT DNA - binding activity , which was sustained for several days , was composed predominantly of Stat1 and Stat3 , and was blocked by cycloheximide and actinomycin D . Increased Stat1 and Stat3 mRNA and protein levels were detected , respectively 4 and 24 h after activation . Stimulation of the cAMP signal transduction pathway , which skews cytokine production toward a Th2 pattern , resulted in the preferential suppression of Stat1 activity . cAMP inhibited the induction of expression of IL - 2 receptor components , but did not inhibit IL - 4 receptor alpha - chain and CD69 expression or the induction of activator protein 1 transcription factors . cAMP signaling inhibited Stat1 at several different levels , including suppression of DNA binding and down - regulation of Stat1 protein and mRNA levels . Our results demonstrate the regulation of STAT activity by a signaling pathway that regulates the T cell functional phenotype and is distinct from the cytokine - activated Janus kinase - STAT signaling pathway . We studied the role of the immediate early gene c - jun in cell proliferation and phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) - induced differentiation in U937 human monoblastic cells , using c - jun - specific antisense ( AS ) phosphorothioate oligonucleotides . In selecting the most specific and potent oligonucleotide sequence , we performed extensive analyses for the binding specificity between all candidates of c - jun AS oligonucleotides and the whole sequences in GenBank database , using a computer program . Among the 20 selected oligonucleotides , two potent 15 - mer AS oligonucleotides ( C - JUN AS oligonucleotides ) exhibited significant inhibition of cell growth in a dose - dependent manner between 2 and 10 microM . Reverse transcription - PCR and Western blot analysis demonstrated that 10 microM of C - JUN AS oligonucleotides reduced c - jun expression at both the mRNA and protein levels . More importantly , C - JUN AS oligonucleotides showed distinct effects on two markers of PMA - induced differentiation ; the C - JUN AS oligonucleotides inhibited cell adhesion , whereas they did not affect another marker of differentiation , respiratory burst ( measured by nitro blue tetrazolium reduction assay ) . These results suggest a critical role of c - jun in both cell proliferation and PMA - induced cell adhesion but not in PMA - induced respiratory burst in U937 cells . Effects of IL - 10 and IL - 4 on LPS - induced transcription factors ( AP - 1 , NF - IL6 and NF - kappa B ) which are involved in IL - 6 regulation . Interleukin - 10 ( IL - 10 ) , like IL - 4 , is known to inhibit cytokine expression in activated human monocytes . We showed that both IL - 10 and IL - 4 inhibit LPS - induced IL - 6 mRNA and protein expression by inhibiting the transcription rate of the IL - 6 gene . The strong inhibition of the IL - 6 transcription rate prompted us to study the effect of IL - 10 and IL - 4 on the expression of transcription factors . We questioned whether or not IL - 10 and IL - 4 affected the expression of transcription factors that are known to be involved in the control of the IL - 6 transcription rate , namely activator protein - 1 ( AP - 1 ) , nuclear factor IL - 6 ( NF - IL6 ) , and nuclear factor kappa B ( NF - kappaB ) . In electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) we showed that IL - 10 and IL - 4 inhibited LPS - induced AP - 1 binding activity . The inhibiting effect of IL - 4 was slightly more pronounced than that of IL - 10 . Downregulation of LPS - induced AP - 1 was accompanied , and thus possibly explained , by a reduced expression at mRNA level of the two major components of the AP - 1 complex , namely c - fos and c - jun as determined by Northern experiments . Binding activity of NF - IL6 was also strongly inhibited by IL - 4 whereas IL - 10 showed no effect . NF - IL6 mRNA levels were not affected by IL - 10 or IL - 4 , suggesting that IL - 4 affects binding activity of preexisting NF - IL6 . Neither IL - 10 nor IL - 4 inhibited LPS - induced NF - kappa B binding activity . In agreement with this finding , Northern experiments where p65 and p105 mRNA levels were determined , demonstrated that expression of these components of the NF - kappa B transcription factor were not affected by IL - 10 or IL - 4 . Furthermore , neither IL - 10 nor IL - 4 showed any effect on I - kappa B mRNA expression as determined by Northern experiments . Thus , IL - 10 and IL - 4 similarly affect IL - 6 expression . However , for IL - 4 this was accompanied with a reduction of AP - 1 and NF - IL6 binding activity whereas IL - 10 only inhibited AP - 1 binding activity . Regulation of GM - CSF gene transcription by core - binding factor . Here we demonstrate that the human GM - CSF promoter and enhancer also encompass binding sites for core - binding factor ( CBF ) . Significantly , the CBF sites are in each case contained within the minimum essential core regions required for inducible activation of transcription . Furthermore , these core regions of the enhancer and promoter each encompass closely linked binding sites for CBF , AP - 1 , and NFATp . The GM - CSF promoter CBF site TGTGGTCA is located 51 bp upstream of the transcription start site and also overlaps a YY - 1 binding site . Stepwise deletions into the proximal promoter also revealed that the CBF site , but not the YY - 1 site , was required for efficient induction of transcriptional activation . This study adds GM - CSF to a growing list of cytokines and receptors that are regulated by CBF and which control the growth , differentiation , and activation of hemopoietic cells . Sublethal levels of oxidative stress stimulate transcriptional activation of c - jun and suppress IL - 2 promoter activation in Jurkat T cells . Sublethal levels of oxidative stress are well known to alter T cell functional responses , but the underlying mechanisms are unknown . The current study examined the effects of oxidative stress on transcriptional activities mediated by c - Fos / c - Jun AP - 1 and the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF - AT ) . The present results show that Jurkat T cells acutely exposed to micromolar concentrations of H2O2 exhibit substantial increases in AP - 1 binding activity and the expression of c - jun but not c - fos mRNA . Similarly , the complexes binding the consensus AP - 1 TRE and jun TRE - like motifs in cells exposed to oxidative signals or PHA / PMA were indistinguishable , being composed of c - Fos , c - Jun , and JunD . However , PHA / PMA but not oxidative signals induced the coordinate activation of reporter constructs containing the AP - 1 - TRE , NF - AT , and IL - 2 promoter regions along with IL - 2 mRNA expression . Gel shift analysis revealed that oxidative suppression of NF - AT represented inhibition in the early generation of NFAT complexes rather than the binding of preformed NF - AT complexes . Inorganic lead activates NF - kappa B in primary human CD4 + T lymphocytes . Inorganic lead ( Pb ) is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant that produces a variety of effects on humoral and cell mediated immune responses . The underlying molecular mechanism for Pb ' s complex effects on the immune system remain obscure . NF - kappa B is critical for T lymphocyte function and is a strong inducer of HIV - LTR activation . We demonstrate that Pb at physiologically relevant concentrations activates NF - kappa B in primary human CD4 + T lymphocytes . Pb - induced activation of NF - kappa B is blocked by antibodies for p65 and p50 subunits but not cRel , indicating that the p65 : p50 heterodimer ( NF - kappa B ) is involved . Functional activation of gene expression by Pb was confirmed using primary CD4 + T cells transfected with an NF - kappa B dependent reporter gene construct . Pb did not activate NF - kappa B in 4 different T cell lines , suggesting that lymphoid cell lines may not be reliable surrogates for the study of transcriptional activation in human T cells . These data suggest that NF - kappa B may be an important molecular mediator of Pb - induced immunotoxicity . The nature of CD40 - dependent signals in proliferating fresh human Epstein - Barr virus - negative B lymphocytes is currently unknown . In this study , a CD40 - dependent B cell culture system was used to examine the role of different signal transduction elements . Protein kinase C ( PKC ) depletion generated by a long - term phorbol 12 myristate 13 - acetate treatment had weak effects on proliferation . The use of the protein tyrosine kinase ( PTK ) - specific inhibitor herbimycin A dramatically decreased cellular proliferation without altering the activity of the human immunodeficiency virus - 1 long terminal repeat ( HIV - 1 LTR ) , a promoter largely dependent on the binding of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF - kappa B ) . In contrast , the cAMP - dependent protein kinase specific inhibitor H - 89 totally inhibited HIV - 1 LTR activity at a concentration as low as 100 nM without affecting cellular proliferation . Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) and supershift assay using an NF - kappa B binding sequence from the kappa light chain as a probe , revealed that both p65 ( RelA ) and c - Rel were present in CD40 - stimulated B cells . While PKC depletion did not alter the NF - kappa B level , treatment of B lymphocytes with H - 89 or herbimycin A provoked a decrease in the NF - kappa B level . These observations establish the importance of different signal transducing pathways leading to CD40 activation of B lymphocytes . Interferons induce normal and aberrant retinoic - acid receptors type alpha in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells : potentiation of the induction of retinoid - dependent differentiation markers . Treatment of the acute promyelocytic ( APL ) cell line NB4 with interferon alpha ( IFN ( alpha ) ) , as well as IFN ( beta ) and gamma , results in an increased expression of the transcripts coding for retinoic - acid receptor type alpha ( RAR ( alpha ) ) and the leukemia - specific retinoic acid receptor PML - RAR . Transcriptional induction of the RAR ( alpha ) and PML - RAR mRNAs is rapid and it is parallelled by an increase in the corresponding proteins . Up - regulation of RAR ( alpha ) and PML - RAR gene expression by IFN ( alpha ) is accompanied by a strong potentiation in the induction of 2 retinoid - dependent granulocytic markers , i . e . , granulocyte - colony - stimulating factor receptor mRNA and leukocyte alkaline phosphatase . However , IFN ( alpha ) does not have any effects on the retinoid - dependent regulation of the myeloid surface markers CD11b and CD33 . The IFN - dependent increase in RAR ( alpha ) levels and the enhancing effect of the cytokine on retinoid - dependent granulocytic markers expression may be a characteristic of PML - RAR positive cells , since the phenomena are not observed in HL - 60 promyelocytes . Interferons as well as retinoids inhibit the growth of NB4 cells , although the 2 classes of compounds do not significantly interact in terms of anti - proliferative activity . These results suggest the possible use of combinations between IFNs and retinoic acid in the cyto - differentiating treatment of APL patients . Modulatory effects of glucocorticoids and catecholamines on human interleukin - 12 and interleukin - 10 production : clinical implications . Interleukin - 12 ( IL - 12 ) is a key inducer of differentiation of uncommitted T helper ( TH ) cells toward the TH1 phenotype , which regulates cellular immunity , whereas IL - 10 inhibits TH1 functions and potentiates TH2 - regulated responses ( i . e . , humoral immunity ) . Dexamethasone inhibited LPS - induced bioactive IL - 12 production in a dose - dependent fashion and at physiologically relevant concentrations ; it had no effect on IL - 10 secretion . The glucocorticoid - induced reduction of IL - 12 production was antagonized by RU 486 , a glucocorticoid - receptor antagonist , suggesting that it was mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor . Norepinephrine and epinephrine also suppressed IL - 12 production in a dose - dependent fashion and at physiological concentrations ; both catecholamines , however , dose - dependently increased the production of IL - 10 . Thus , stress may cause a selective suppression of TH1 functions and a shift toward a TH2 cytokine pattern rather than generalized TH suppression . The TH1 - to - TH2 shift may be responsible for the stress - induced susceptibility of the organism to certain infections . Through the same or a reciprocal mechanism , states associated with chronic hyperactivity or hypoactivity of the stress system might influence the susceptibility of an individual to certain autoimmune , allergic , infectious , or neoplastic diseases . Activation of human monocytic cells by Treponema pallidum and Borrelia burgdorferi lipoproteins and synthetic lipopeptides proceeds via a pathway distinct from that of lipopolysaccharide but involves the transcriptional activator NF - kappa B . A principal objective of the present study was to identify more precisely similarities and divergences among lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - and lipoprotein - lipopeptide - induced immune cell signaling events . Like LPS , purified native B . burgdorferi OspA and synthetic analogs of OspA , OspB , and two T . pallidum lipoproteins ( Tpp47 and Tpp17 ) all induced NF - kappa B translocation in THP - 1 human monocytoid cells . By using 70Z / 3 - derived pre - B - cell lines either lacking or expressing human CD14 ( the LPS receptor ) , it was observed that expression of human CD14 imparted responsiveness to LPS but not to OspA or spirochetal lipopeptides ( assessed by induction of NF - kappa B and expression of surface immunoglobulin M ) . The combined data lend additional support to the proposal that spirochetal lipoproteins and LPS initiate monocyte activation via different cell surface events but that the signaling pathways ultimately converge to produce qualitatively similar cellular responses . LYSP100 - associated nuclear domains ( LANDs ) : description of a new class of subnuclear structures and their relationship to PML nuclear bodies . The PML gene is fused to the retinoic acid receptor alpha ( RAR alpha ) gene in t ( 15 ; 17 ) acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) , creating a PML - RAR alpha fusion oncoprotein . The PML gene product has been localized to subnuclear dot - like structures variously termed PODs , ND10s , Kr bodies , or PML nuclear bodies ( PML NBs ) . In addition to SP100 homology regions , one LYSP100 cDNA isoform contains a bromodomain and a PHD / TTC domain , which are present in a variety of transcriptional regulatory proteins . By immunofluorescence , LYSP100 was localized to nuclear dots that were surprisingly largely nonoverlapping with PML NBs . However , a minority of LYSP100 nuclear dots exactly colocalized with PML and SP100 . Although LYSP100 is expressed only in lymphoid cells , LANDs could be visualized in HeLa cells by transfection of a LYSP100 cDNA . LANDs were most often found in the nucleoplasm , but were also found at the nuclear membrane and in the cytoplasm , suggesting that these structures may traffic between the cytoplasm and the nucleus . By double - immunogold labeling of PML and LYSP100 , some LANDs were shown to contain both PML and LYSP100 . Thus , PML is localized to a second subnuclear domain that is morphologically and biochemically distinct from PML NBs . However , more recent studies in human T cell lines have suggested that the N - terminal domain is not necessary for steroid - regulated apoptosis and that GR - mediated transrepression may be the more critical mechanism . GR expression levels were shown to be rate - limiting for initiating the apoptotic pathway , and a positive correlation between steroid sensitivity and GR - mediated induction of an integrated mouse mammary tumor virus ( MMTV ) LTR reporter gene was observed . Analysis of GR chimeric receptors containing the potent VP16 and E1A viral transactivation domains in place of the GR N terminus revealed that even low level expression of these receptors resulted in both enhanced steroid sensitivity and MMTV induction , thus supporting a role for transactivation in apoptosis . In contrast , we found that AR can initiate apoptosis in S49 cells after treatment with 5 alpha - dihydrotestosterone , despite its relative inability to induce high level expression of MMTV . To investigate this further , we examined the steroid - regulated expression of an endogenous thymocyte - specific gene called GIG18 . We found that GIG18 was rapidly induced to comparable levels by both AR and GR , demonstrating that AR can indeed function as a transcriptional activator in S49 cells and , moreover , that GIG18 induction may be a marker of early apoptotic events in steroid - treated cells . Taken together , these results support our conclusion that transcriptional transactivation is a necessary signaling component of S49 cell apoptosis , although an additional role for GR - mediated transrepression can not be excluded . Multiple p21ras effector pathways regulate nuclear factor of activated T cells . The transcription factor , Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells ( NFAT ) is a major target for p21ras and calcium signalling pathways in the IL - 2 gene and is induced by p21ras signals acting in synergy with calcium / calcineurin signals . Expression of dominant negative MAPKK - 1 prevents NFAT induction . Constitutively active MAPKK - 1 fully activates ERK - 2 and the transcription factor Elk - 1 , but does not substitute for activated p21ras and synergize with calcium / calcineurin signals to induce NFAT . Expression of dominant negative N17Rac also prevents TCR and p21ras activation of NFAT , but without interfering with the ERK - 2 pathway . The transcriptional activity of the NFAT binding site is mediated by a complex comprising a member of the NFAT group and AP - 1 family proteins . The induction of AP - 1 by p21ras also requires Rac - 1 function . Activated Rac - 1 could mimic activated p21ras to induce AP - 1 but not to induce NFAT . Moreover , the combination of activated MAPKK - 1 and Rac - 1 could not substitute for activated p21ras and synergize with calcium signals to induce NFAT . Thus , p21ras regulation of NFAT in T cells requires the activity of multiple effector pathways including those regulated by MAPKK - 1 / ERK - 2 and Rac - 1 . Retinoid differentiation therapy in promyelocytic leukemia . Acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) is a specific type of acute myeloid leukemia characterized by the morphology of the blast cells , a specific t ( 15 ; 17 ) translocation , and risks of definite coagulopathy . Recently this leukemia was further characterized by an exquisite sensitivity to all - trans retinoic acid ' s differentiation effect and the production of a fusion gene altering the gene of RARalpha and a novel gene PML . Differential utilization of Janus kinase - signal transducer activator of transcription signaling pathways in the stimulation of human natural killer cells by IL - 2 , IL - 12 , and IFN - alpha . IL - 2 induced less STAT1 alpha activation and IFN - alpha induced greater STAT5 activation in NK3 . 3 cells compared with preactivated primary NK cells . In NK3 . 3 cells , IL - 2 induced comparable formation of c - fos promoter sis - inducible element IFN - gamma - activated sequence - binding complexes containing STAT3 alone with complexes containing STAT3 and STAT1 alpha , while in preactivated primary NK cells , it preferentially induced complexes containing STAT3 and STAT1 alpha . Thus , signaling in NK3 . 3 cells is not always identical with that in primary NK cells . In contrast to IL - 2 and IFN - alpha , IL - 12 induced strong tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT4 and variable weak phosphorylation of STAT3 . However , supershift analyses using the c - fos promoter sis - inducible element probe showed that IL - 12 activated STAT4 , STAT1 alpha , and STAT3 , and induced complexes containing STAT4 only , STAT4 with STAT1 alpha , STAT3 with STAT1 alpha , or STAT1 alpha only in preactivated primary NK cells . Finally , IL - 2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3 , while IL - 12 induced phosphorylation of JAK2 and TYK2 in both preactivated primary NK and NK3 . 3 cells . Differential phosphorylation and consequent differential activation of both separate and overlapping STAT proteins by IL - 2 , IL - 12 , and IFN - alpha may provide a molecular basis for the similarities and differences in the actions of these cytokines on NK cells . The suppression of T cell function and NF ( kappa ) B expression by serine protease inhibitors is blocked by N - acetylcysteine . The proliferative responses of purified CD4 + or CD8 + T cells are suppressed more strongly by TPCK when anti - CD28 rather than the phorbol ester PMA is used as the mitogenic coactivator . Cytokine ( IL - 2 , IL - 6 , INF - gamma ) production is inhibited 95 - 100 % by concentrations of TPCK that totally suppress the mitogenesis of CD4 + or CD8 + cells . Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , we find that TPCK virtually abolishes ( to less than 1 % ) the levels of NF ( kappa ) B ( but not Oct - 1 ) found in nuclear and whole cell extracts of activated T cells . NAC not only blocks the effect of TPCK but enhances mitogenesis and cytokine production ( > 2 . 5 - fold in some cases ) upon activation of unsuppressed T cells . Signaling by IL - 2 and related cytokines : JAKs , STATs , and relationship to immunodeficiency . Cytokines that bind to the interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) receptor common gamma chain ( gamma c ) , including IL - 2 , IL - 4 , IL - 7 , IL - 9 , and IL - 15 , are important for the growth and differentiation of T and B lymphocytes , natural killer cells , macrophages , and monoctyes . These cytokines have overlapping biological effects that in part result from the use of the shared receptor subunit gamma c . The discovery of these signaling pathways has led to important new insights into their role in lymphocyte maturation , as it has emerged that mutations in the genes encoding both gamma c and JAK3 result in similar forms of severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID ) . Furthermore , we discuss recent advances that have led to a better understanding of how cytokines elicit intracellular responses , as well as their role in normal lymphoid development . Cytomegalovirus modulates interleukin - 6 gene expression . Complications after lung transplantation include the development of rejection and an increased incidence of infection , particularly with cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) . Several recent studies have suggested that interleukin ( IL ) - 6 may be used to detect both infection and rejection after lung transplantation . In addition , IL - 6 may play a role in the development of bronchiolitis obliterans after transplantation . Because CMV is also associated with the development of bronchiolitis obliterans after transplantation , we determined whether CMV induces IL - 6 gene expression . We demonstrated that CMV infection increased both IL - 6 protein and mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells . We also demonstrated that the CMV immediate early 1 gene product increased expression of the IL - 6 promoter . This effect of the CMV immediate early 1 gene product was dependent upon the presence of specific transcription factor binding sites in the IL - 6 promoter . These studies demonstrate that CMV may be an important cofactor in the development of rejection and infection after transplantation through its effects on IL - 6 . Vitamin D3 - and retinoic acid - induced monocytic differentiation : interactions between the endogenous vitamin D3 receptor , retinoic acid receptors , and retinoid X receptors in U - 937 cells . VitD3 induction resulted in the formation of VDR / RXR DNA - binding complexes on both VitD3 response elements and RA response elements ( RAREs ) . Several DNA - binding complexes were detected on RAREs in undifferentiated cells . Stimulation by RA resulted in increased RAR beta / RXR DNA binding , activated RARE - dependent transcription , and increased expression of RAR - beta . Concomitant stimulation by VitD3 inhibited the RA - stimulated formation of RAR beta / RXR heterodimers , favoring VDR / RXR binding to the RARE . In contrast , neither the RA - stimulated , RARE - mediated transcription nor the induced RAR - beta expression was suppressed by VitD3 , suggesting that VitD3 selectively inhibited the retinoid - induced differentiation program but not the RARE - mediated signal . These results demonstrate a complex role for VitD3 in modifying the retinoid differentiation pathway and may have implications for differentiation - inducing therapy of hematopoietic tumors . The human T - cell leukemia virus type 1 posttranscriptional trans - activator Rex contains a nuclear export signal . The Rex protein of human T - cell leukemia virus type 1 is required for the nuclear export of unspliced viral mRNA and , therefore , for virus replication . In this manuscript , we demonstrate that Rex shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and that its activation domain constitutes a nuclear export signal that specifies efficient transport to the cytoplasm . These findings are consistent with a model for Rex - mediated trans - activation in which Rex - viral mRNA complexes are targeted for nuclear export by the direct action of the activation domain . Granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor preferentially activates the 94 - kD STAT5A and an 80 - kD STAT5A isoform in human peripheral blood monocytes . Granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) induces immediate effects in monocytes by activation of the Janus kinase ( JAK2 ) and STAT transcription factor ( STAT5 ) pathway . Recent studies have identified homologues of STAT5 , STAT5A , and STAT5B , as well as lower molecular weight variants of STAT5 . To define the activation of the STAT5 homologues and lower molecular weight variant in human monocytes and monocytes differentiated into macrophages by culture in macrophage - CSF ( M - CSF ) , we measured the GM - CSF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5A , STAT5B , and any lower molecular weight STAT5 isoforms . Whereas 94 - kD STAT5A was clearly tyrosine phosphorylated and bound to the enhancer element , the gamma response region ( GRR ) , of the Fc gamma RI gene , substantially less tyrosine phosphorylated STAT5B bound to the immobilized GRR element . Macrophages lost their ability to express the 80 - kD STAT5A protein , but retained their ability to activate STAT5A . Therefore , activation of STAT5A predominates compared to STAT5B when assayed by direct immunoprecipitation and by evaluation of bound STATs to immobilized GRR . Selective activation of STAT5 homologues in addition to generation of lower molecular isoforms may provide specificity and control to genes expressed in response to cytokines such as GM - CSF . We report a 65 - year - old woman with non - Hodgkin ' s lymphoma ( NHL ) carrying a t ( 3 ; 14 ) ( q27 ; q11 ) and BCL6 rearrangement in the affected cells . She had generalized lymphadenopathy and the bone marrow was infiltrated by lymphoma cells at presentation . Histological diagnosis was ` ` malignant lymphoma , diffuse , large cell ' ' type according to an International Working Formulation . Chromosome analysis revealed a t ( 3 ; 14 ) ( q27 ; q11 ) , which is a new variant translocation of t ( 3 ; 14 ) ( q27 ; q32 ) . Cosmid probe of BCL6 hybridized to 14q11 and 3q27 by fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) . Although the band 14q11 is a locus of T - cell receptor alpha - and delta - chains ( TCR alpha / delta ) , lymphoma cells expressed B - cell , IgGk phenotype . The findings suggest that a novel proto - oncogene in the vicinity of TCR alpha / delta is involved in this translocation . Transgenic expression of PML / RARalpha impairs myelopoiesis . The translocation found in acute promyelocytic leukemia rearranges the promyelocytic leukemia gene ( PML ) on chromosome 15 with the retinoic acid receptor alpha ( RARalpha ) on chromosome 17 . This yields a fusion transcript , PML / RARalpha , a transcription factor with reported dominant negative functions in the absence of hormone . Clinical remissions induced with all - trans retinoic acid ( RA ) treatment in acute promyelocytic leukemia are linked to PML / RARalpha expression in leukemic cells . To evaluate the PML / RARalpha role in myelopoiesis , transgenic mice expressing PML / RARalpha were engineered . A full - length PML / RARalpha cDNA driven by the CD11b promoter was expressed in transgenic mice . Expression was confirmed in the bone marrow with a reverse transcription PCR assay . Cell sorter analysis of CD11b + bone marrow cells revealed similar CD11b + populations in transgenic and control mice . However , in vitro clonal growth assays performed on peripheral blood from transgenic versus control mice revealed a marked reduction of myeloid progenitors , especially in those responding to granulocyte / macrophage colony - stimulating factor . Granulocyte / macrophage colony - stimulating factor and kit ligand cotreatment did not overcome this inhibition . Impaired myelopoiesis in vivo was shown by stressing these mice with sublethal irradiation . Following irradiation , PML / RARalpha transgenic mice , as compared with controls , more rapidly depressed peripheral white blood cell and granulocyte counts . Lethality was associated with more severe leukopenia in transgenic versus control mice . Retinoic acid treatment of irradiated PML / RARalpha mice enhanced granulocyte recovery . These data suggest that abnormal myelopoiesis due to PML / RARalpha expression is an early event in oncogenic transformation . C / EBP activators are required for HIV - 1 replication and proviral induction in monocytic cell lines . Previous work has shown that C / EBP sites and C / EBP transcriptional activators are necessary for HIV - 1 LTR activity in monocytes / macrophages . We have investigated the role that C / EBP proteins play in induction and replication of HIV - 1 . Ectopic expression of the dominant negative C / EBP protein LIP inhibited HIV - 1 mRNA and virus production in activated U1 cells , demonstrating that C / EBP proteins are required for provirus induction . U1 lines overexpressing C / EBP activator NF - IL - 6 produced more viral mRNA and virus particles following cellular activation than control lines , demonstrating that C / EBP proteins are limiting for virus transcription . HIV - 1 harboring mutations within two C / EBP sites were crippled in their ability to replicate in U937 promonocytic cells , indicating that these sites are required for replication . These data identify C / EBP proteins as regulators of HIV - 1 expression in monocytes / macrophages . Epstein - Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 and latent membrane protein independently transactivate p53 through induction of NF - kappaB activity . In studies initiated to evaluate relationships between EBV latent genes and p53 , p53 levels were found to increase approximately 10 - fold 4 to 5 days after EBV infection of purified resting human B cells ; the induced p53 was transcriptionally active . Cooperation between core binding factor and adjacent promoter elements contributes to the tissue - specific expression of interleukin - 3 . This is achieved in part through the positive activities of the AP - 1 and Elf - 1 sites in the IL - 3 promoter . The contribution to T cell - specific expression by other promoter sites was assessed in a transient expression assay with IL - 3 promoter constructs linked to a luciferase gene , focusing initially on the core binding factor ( CBF ) site , which is footprinted in vivo upon T cell activation . Activity of the CBF site is shown to be critically dependent on the adjacent activator site Act - 1 . Together the Act - 1 and CBF sites form a functional unit ( AC unit ) with dual activity . The AC unit is demonstrated to enhance basal activity of promoters both in fibroblasts and T cells . This activity is further inducible in activated T cells , but not in fibroblasts . Finally , a novel positive regulatory element has been mapped in the IL - 3 promoter between nucleotide - 180 and - 210 that leads to increased expression in T cells . Together these results demonstrate that T cell expression of IL - 3 is not specified by the activity of a single tissue - specific element , but instead involves multiple interacting elements that provide both specific positive regulation in T cells and specific negative regulation in fibroblasts . Modulation of the expression of the IFN - gamma receptor beta - chain controls responsiveness to IFN - gamma in human peripheral blood T cells . IFN - gamma has potent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects in T cells that are important in determining T cell development and polarized differentiation . Therefore , any event that enables T cells to become less responsive to IFN - gamma may potentially alter immune responsiveness to Ag . In this work , we show that human peripheral blood T cells that are stimulated through the TCR and expanded with IL - 2 are unresponsive to IFN - gamma , as determined by a lack of activation of jak kinases and the transcription factor , STAT1 ( alpha ) , a signal transducer and activator of transcription . This nonresponsiveness occurs because of a lack of expression of the beta - chain ( accessory factor ) of the IFN - gamma receptor , while at the same time maintaining IFN - gamma receptor alpha - chain expression . Expression of the beta - chain can be restored by secondary TCR ligation or PMA treatment . T cell blasts treated with PMA are now responsive to IFN - gamma . When freshly isolated , highly enriched ( > 98 % ) T cells are examined for IFN - gamma responsiveness ; these cells can respond to IFN - gamma and express beta - chain . Therefore , as T cells progress from primary TCR activation through IL - 2 - dependent proliferation , followed by secondary TCR stimulation , their responsiveness to IFN - gamma varies , and this may affect their ability to participate in an ongoing immune response . Age - related decreases in IL - 2 production by human T cells are associated with impaired activation of nuclear transcriptional factors AP - 1 and NF - AT . Although transcriptional factors AP - 1 and nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF - AT ) are important for the normal induction of IL - 2 , it is unknown if the age - related decline in IL - 2 production by activated human T cells may be associated with aberrancies in transcriptional regulatory proteins . Substantial decreases of IL - 2 production were observed for cell cultures from 7 of 12 elderly individuals in response to the different stimuli , whereas the levels of IL - 2 produced by stimulated T cells from other elderly individuals were equivalent to those observed for stimulated T cells of young subjects . Analyses of nuclear extracts by electrophoretic DNA mobility shift assays showed that decreased IL - 2 production by stimulated T cells of elderly individuals was closely associated with impairments in the activation of both AP - 1 and NF - AT . In addition , the results of competition experiments analyzing the normal components of NF - AT showed that the age - related reductions in stimulus - dependent NF - AT complexes corresponded to the slow migrating complexes that were composed of c - Fos / c - Jun AP - 1 . The resting and stimulated levels of NF kappa B were reduced in T cells from certain elderly individuals ; however , alterations of NF kappa B did not correlate with changes in IL - 2 expression . Thus , these results show that age - related impairments in the activation of AP - 1 and NF - AT are closely associated with decreased expression of IL - 2 and further suggest that aberrancies in the signaling pathways important for the induction of transcriptionally active c - Fos / c - Jun AP - 1 may contribute to the impaired activation of NF - AT . IL - 13 induces phosphorylation and activation of JAK2 Janus kinase in human colon carcinoma cell lines : similarities between IL - 4 and IL - 13 signaling . We have recently reported that IL - 13R may share a component with IL - 4R . Here we report that both IL - 4 and IL - 13 share signaling events in human colon carcinoma cell lines ( HT - 29 and WiDr ) . We show that JAK2 kinase is rapidly phosphorylated and activated in response to IL - 13 . Within 1 min of activation , JAK2 was phosphorylated , and peaked in 10 min . In addition , IL - 13 phosphorylated insulin response substrate - 1 , IL - 4R p140 , JAK1 , and Tyk2 , but not JAK3 kinase . Both IL - 13 and IL - 4 induced phosphorylation of IL - 4 STAT ( STAT6 ) but not STAT1 , STAT3 , or STAT5 . 125I - IL - 13 did not bind to colon cancer cell lines , but unlabeled IL - 13 competed for the binding of 125I - IL - 4 . Our data suggest that IL - 13 utilizes IL - 4R and its signaling pathway , and JAK2 may play an important role in the function of IL - 4R and IL - 13R in colon cancer cells . IL - 4 and IL - 10 inhibit the cytokine production and mRNA expression by monocytes / macrophages . Both IL - 4 and IL - 10 were seen to inhibit IL - 6 production and the expression of IL - 6 mRNA in both monocytic cell lines studied . Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that IL - 4 , but not IL - 10 , inhibited nuclear NF - kappaB activity , and that IL - 4 and IL - 10 did not affect NF - IL - 6 activity . Therefore , we conclude that IL - 4 and IL - 10 inhibit IL - 6 production by different mechanisms in human monocytic cell lines . Activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells in a cyclosporin A - resistant pathway . The mechanism of action of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A ( CsA ) is the inactivation of the Ca2 + / calmodulin - dependent serine - threonine phosphatase calcineurin by the drug - immunophilin complex . Inactive calcineurin is unable to activate the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) , a transcription factor required for expression of the interleukin 2 ( IL - 2 ) gene . We demonstrate here , however , that NFAT can be activated , and significant levels of IL - 2 can be produced by the CsA - resistant CD28 - signaling pathway . In transient transfection assays , both multicopy NFAT - and IL - 2 promoter - beta - galactosidase reporter gene constructs could be activated by phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) / alpha - CD28 stimulation , and this activation was resistant to CsA . Peripheral blood T cells stimulated with PMA / alphaCD28 produced IL - 2 in the presence of CsA . Collectively , these data suggest that NFAT can be activated and IL - 2 can be produced in a calcineurin independent manner . Effects of interleukin - 10 on human peripheral blood mononuclear cell responses to Cryptococcus neoformans , Candida albicans , and lipopolysaccharide . IL - 10 effected dose - dependent inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - alpha ) release in PBMC stimulated by LPS and C . neoformans , with significant inhibition seen with 0 . 1 U / ml and greater than 90 % inhibition noted with 10 U / ml . In contrast , even at doses as high as 100 U / ml , IL - 10 inhibited TNF - alpha release in response to C . albicans by only 50 % . IL - 10 profoundly inhibited release of IL - 1beta from PBMC stimulated by all three stimuli . TNF - alpha mRNA and release was inhibited even if IL - 10 was added up to 8 h after cryptococcal stimulation . In contrast , inhibition of IL - 1 beta mRNA was of lesser magnitude and occurred only when IL - 10 was added within 2 h of cryptococcal stimulation . IL - 10 inhibited translocation of NF - kappaB in response to LPS but not the fungal stimuli . All three stimuli induced IL - 10 production in PBMC , although over 10 - fold less IL - 10 was released in response to C . neoformans compared with LPS and C . albicans . Thus , while IL - 10 has deactivating effects on PBMC responses to all three stimuli , disparate stimulus - and response - specific patterns of deactivation are seen . Inhibition by IL - 10 of proinflammatory cytokine release appears to occur at the level of gene transcription for TNF - alpha and both transcriptionally and posttranscriptionall for IL - 1beta . Identification as lymphocyte - specific protein 1 ( LSP1 ) . Incubation of B - chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( B - CLL ) cells with phorbol esters resulted in the phosphorylation of two major PKC substrates , MARCKS ( myristoylated , alanine - rich C kinase substrate ) and MRP ( MARCKS - related protein ) , and of a third protein , with an apparent m . w . of 60 , 000 that was the most prominent protein kinase C substrate in these cells . p60 phosphorylation was time and PMA dose dependent , and was induced by cell - permeable diacylglycerol , but not by inactive phorbol esters . Two - dimensional electrophoretic analysis of the protein phosphorylation pattern from the B cell line CESS demonstrated the identity between the p60 protein expressed in this cell line and that expressed in B - CLL cells . p60 was purified from CESS cells and peptide microsequencing of this protein revealed that it was lymphocyte - specific protein 1 ( LSP1 ) , that is here characterized as the most prominent protein kinase C substrate in B cells . Transcription factors of T and B lymphocytes - - basic research and clinical perspectives for gastroenterology . Tissue specific regulation of gene expression by transcription factors is a fascinating new field in molecular immunology . This review summarizes data on specific regulation of promoters and enhancers by nuclear trans - acting factors in lymphocytes . The structural classes of transcription factors are described and basic methods for detection and analysis of transcription factors are detailed . Furthermore , the most important trans - acting factors of T and B lymphocytes ( e . g . NF - kB , NF - AT and STAT families ) and their functional importance are described . Several methods for specific down - regulation of transcription factors are shown that may be relevant to treatment of human disease . The data are discussed with regard to their potential clinical relevance for gastroenterology . Selective effects of DNA damaging agents on HIV long terminal repeat activation and virus replication in vitro . Much attention has recently focused on the observation that UV light can activate the long terminal repeat ( LTR ) of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Although the mechanism of LTR activation remains obscure , several lines of investigation have suggested that it is a result of activation of the NF - kappa B transcription factor ( s ) following signaling events related to generalized DNA damage . In this report , we present data demonstrating that HIV LTR activation is not a general consequence of cellular DNA damage , but rather a process unique to specific genotoxic stimuli , and that it does not necessarily depend on activation of NF - kappa B . Furthermore , we demonstrate that several of these agents can significantly increase HIV replication and accelerate CD4 - positive lymphocyte cytotoxicity in vitro . Receptors for interleukin ( IL ) - 10 and IL - 6 - type cytokines use similar signaling mechanisms for inducing transcription through IL - 6 response elements . The cytoplasmic domain of the receptor for interleukin 10 ( IL - 10R ) contains two box 3 sequence motifs that have been identified in the signal - transducing receptor subunits for IL - 6 - type cytokines and noted to be required for activating STAT3 and inducing transcription through IL - 6 - responsive elements . Both cytokines activated factors that bound to the sis - inducible element and included STAT1 and STAT3 . The cell response to IL - 10 characteristically differed from that to IL - 2 / IL - 15 , IL - 4 , and interferon gamma . The signaling capabilities of the IL - 10R for activating specific STAT proteins and inducing gene transcription were defined by reconstitution of receptor functions in transfected tissue culture cells . COS - 1 cells , co - expressing the human IL - 10R and individual STAT proteins , confirmed a preference of the IL - 10R for STAT3 and STAT1 . Unlike many hematopoietin receptors , the IL - 10R did not detectably activate STAT5 . This regulation could not be appreciably modified by enhanced expression of STAT proteins . The similar actions of IL - 10R and IL - 6R on the induction of endogenous IL - 6 - responsive genes were demonstrated in hepatoma cells stably expressing the IL - 10R . The data demonstrate that the IL - 10R , unlike other members of the interferon receptor family , is highly effective in recruiting the signaling pathways of IL - 6 - type cytokine receptors . Induction of CIITA and modification of in vivo HLA - DR promoter occupancy in normal thymic epithelial cells treated with IFN - gamma : similarities and distinctions with respect to HLA - DR - constitutive B cells . In this study , the IFN - gamma induction of MHC class II gene expression in primary cultures of thymic epithelial cells ( TEC ) was analyzed . This cellular system offers the advantage that MHC class II induction is studied in a ` ` physiologic ' ' cell lineage that , as a result of this expression within the thymus , is thought to participate to the selection and maturation of the T cells . It was found that the MHC class II gene expression was associated with the de novo transcription of the gene encoding the CIITA trans - activator , a crucial MHC class II gene regulatory factor . Furthermore , the anatomy of interaction between the MHC class II DRA promoter and corresponding binding factors was analyzed by in vivo DNAse I footprint . It was found that treatment with IFN - gamma induces changes in the occupancy of the DRA gene regulatory sequences by nuclear factors . The resulting occupancy displays strong similarities with the one observed in the MHC class II - constitutive B cells , represented by both the Burkitt lymphoma line Raji and normal tonsil - derived B cells . However , some peculiar differences were observed between the TEC , either IFN - gamma - induced or not , and the constitutive B cells . Inhibitory effect of E3330 , a novel quinone derivative able to suppress tumor necrosis factor - alpha generation , on activation of nuclear factor - kappa B . ( 2E ) - 3 - [ 5 - ( 2 , 3 - Dimethoxy - 6 - methyl - 1 , 4 - benzoquinoyl ) ] - 2 - nonyl - 2 - propenoic acid ( E3330 ) , is a novel agent with hepatoprotective activity . We report the effect of E3330 on transcriptional activation of tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - alpha gene and on nuclear factor ( NF ) - kappa B activation . Nuclear run - on experiments showed that E3330 decreases transcriptional activation of TNF - alpha gene induced by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) stimulation in human peripheral monocytes . To investigate the inhibitory mechanisms , we constructed a secreted - type placental alkaline phosphatase ( PLAP ) reporter gene whose transcription is controlled by a 1 . 4 - kb human TNF - alpha promoter . A stable transformant of the PLAP reporter gene derived from human monocytic cell line showed very little activity on the promoter before stimulation , whereas LPS stimulation led to a dramatic increase in PLAP activity . By using mutated promoter - PLAP plasmids , we established that these NF - kappa B sites were necessary for induction of TNF - alpha transcription on stimulation with LPS . A gel retardation experiment with synthetic double - stranded oligonucleotides showed that activated NF - kappa B consisting of p50 / p65 heterodimer bound to all four putative NF - kappa B DNA probes , suggesting that all four putative NF - kappa B recognition sites play an important role in inducible TNF - alpha expression . E3330 decreased activated NF - kappa B in nuclei , suggesting that E3330 inhibits NF - kappa B activation and / or translocation of the nuclei . Western blotting analysis with anti - I kappa B - alpha antibody indicated that E3330 inhibited degradation of I kappa B - alpha , which is an inhibitory protein of NF - kappa B , in LPS - stimulated monocytes . E3330 may suppress the production of active oxygen species serving as common messengers to activate NF - kappa B . C - terminal activating and inhibitory domains determine the transactivation potential of BSAP ( Pax - 5 ) , Pax - 2 and Pax - 8 . Pax - 5 encodes the transcription factor BSAP which plays an essential role in early B cell development and midbrain patterning . In vitro mutagenesis and transient transfection experiments indicate that the C - terminal serine / threonine / proline - rich region of BSAP contains a potent transactivation domain of 55 amino acids which is active from promoter and enhancer positions . This transactivation domain was found to be inactivated by a naturally occurring frameshift mutation in one PAX - 5 allele of the acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line REH . The function of the transactivation domain is negatively regulated by adjacent sequences from the extreme C - terminus . The activating and inhibitory domains function together as an independent regulatory module in different cell types as shown by fusion to the GAL4 DNA binding domain . The same arrangement of positively and negatively acting sequences has been conserved in the mammalian Pax - 2 and Pax - 8 , the zebrafish Pax - b as well as the sea urchin Pax - 258 proteins . These data demonstrate that the transcriptional competence of a subfamily of Pax proteins is determined by a C - terminal regulatory module composed of activating and inhibitory sequences . Second messenger up - regulation of androgen receptor gene transcription is absent in androgen insensitive human prostatic carcinoma cell lines , PC - 3 and DU - 145 . A theoretical pathway of transcriptional regulation of the androgen receptor ( AR ) gene is via a cAMP response element ( CRE ) present in its promoter region ( - 508 to - 501 ) . After 20 h of stimulation with 8 - bromo - cAMP , AR mRNA was upregulated in LNCaP but not in either PC - 3 or DU - 145 cell lines . The ability to regulate AR gene transcription via the second messenger pathway is lost in the PC - 3 and DU - 145 cell lines . This may be an important primary mechanism of androgen insensitivity in prostate cancer . CD36 is a cell surface glycoprotein composed of a single polypeptide chain , which interacts with thrombospondin , collagens type I and IV , oxidized low density lipoprotein , fatty acids , anionic phospholipids , and erythrocytes parasitized with Plasmodium falciparum . Its expression is restricted to a few cell types , including monocyte / macrophages . To study the molecular mechanisms that control the transcription of the CD36 gene in monocytic cells we have isolated and analyzed the CD36 promoter . Transient expression experiments of 5 ' - deletion fragments of the CD36 promoter coupled to luciferase demonstrated that as few as 158 base pairs upstream from the transcription initiation site were sufficient to direct the monocyte - specific transcription of the reporter gene . Within the above region , the fragment spanning nucleotides - 158 to - 90 was required for optimal transcription in monocytic cells . The involvement of members of the PEBP2 / CBF family in chromosome translocations associated with acute myeloid leukemia , and in the transcriptional regulation of the myeloid - specific genes encoding for myeloperoxidase , elastase , and the colony - stimulating factor receptor , highlights the relevance of the regulation of the CD36 gene promoter in monocytic cells by members of the PEBP2 / CBF family . HLA - DQB1 codon 57 is critical for peptide binding and recognition . The polymorphism at residue 57 of the DQB1 polypeptide is of particular interest since it may play a major structural role in the formation of a salt bridge structure at one end of the peptide - binding cleft of the DQ molecules . This polymorphism at residue 57 is a recurrent feature of HLA - DQ evolution , occurring in multiple distinct allelic families , which implies a functional selection for maintaining variation at this position in the class II molecule . We directly tested the amino acid polymorphism at this site as a determinant for peptide binding and for antigen - specific T cell stimulation . We found that a single Ala - - > Asp amino acid 57 substitution in an HLA - DQ3 . 2 molecule regulated binding of an HSV - 2 VP - 16 - derived peptide . A complementary single - residue substitution in the peptide abolished its binding to DQ3 . 2 and converted it to a peptide that can bind to DQ3 . 1 and DQ3 . 3 Asp - 57 - positive MHC molecules . These binding studies were paralleled by specific T cell recognition of the class II - peptide complex , in which the substituted peptide abolished T cell reactivity , which was directed to the DQ3 . 2 - peptide complex , whereas the same T cell clone recognized the substituted peptide presented by DQ3 . 3 , a class II restriction element differing from DQ3 . 2 only at residue 57 . This structural and functional complementarity for residue 57 and a specific peptide residue identifies this interaction as a key controlling determinant of restricted recognition in HLA - DQ - specific immune response . Autocrine activation by interferon - gamma of STAT factors following T cell activation . The activation of T cells requires engagement of the T cell receptor / CD3 complex and co - stimulatory molecules , and results in the triggering of several signaling pathways which lead rapidly to the nuclear translocation of several transcription factors , such as nuclear factor ( NF ) - kappa B and NF - AT . A result of this activation process is the induction of a number of genes , including those encoding cytokines such as interleukin - 2 , tumor necrosis factor - alpha , and interferon ( IFN ) - gamma which have important immunoregulatory effects . We report here that a DNA - binding factor containing STAT1 also becomes activated in human peripheral blood T lymphocytes or Jurkat cells , although not until 1 - 2 h after stimulation . Activation is delayed a further 1 - 2 hr when mononuclear cell cultures are stimulated by an antigen which requires processing . Absence of T - cell - and B - cell - specific transcription factors TCF - 1 , GATA - 3 , and BSAP in Hodgkin ' s Reed - Sternberg cells . The information obtained from these cell lines has also been used in arguments for a lymphoid origin of H - RS cells in tissue despite the frequent absence of lymphoid markers and Ig / TcR gene rearrangements in these cells . We questioned whether one can use the limited expression of lymphoid markers or the limited gene rearrangement to conclude that H - RS cells have a lymphoid origin , because these markers may be aberrant in tumor cells . In this study , we examined the expression of two T - cell - specific transcription factors ( TCF - 1 and GATA - 3 ) and one B - cell - specific transcription factor ( BSAP ) in cultured H - RS cells by using a gel mobility shift assay . The sensitivity and specificity of this assay for determination of cell lineage have been established in a large number of cultured human and murine cell lines . All three types of H - RS cell lines were consistently negative for BSAP , TCF - 1 , and GATA - 3 . The absence of GATA - 3 was confirmed in H - RS cells in tissues by an in situ hybridization technique . Virtually all B - cell lines , with the exception of some myeloma cell lines , are positive for BSAP , which is the transcription factor for promoters for several B - cell markers , including VpreB1 , lambda 5 , CD19 , and CD20 . All T - cell lines tested were positive for TCF - 1 and GATA - 3 , which are the transcription factors for promoters for several T - cell - restricted markers , including CD2 , CD3 , TcR , and lck . The absence of BSAP , TCF - 1 , and GATA - 3 clearly indicates an underlying difference between H - RS cells and lymphoid cells . MEK1 and the extracellular signal - regulated kinases are required for the stimulation of IL - 2 gene transcription in T cells . TCR engagement stimulates the activation of the protein kinase Raf - 1 . Active Raf - 1 phosphorylates and activates the mitogen - activated protein ( MAP ) kinase / extracellular signal - regulated kinase kinase 1 ( MEK1 ) , which in turn phosphorylates and activates the MAP kinases / extracellular signal regulated kinases , ERK1 and ERK2 . Raf - 1 activity promotes IL - 2 production in activated T lymphocytes . Therefore , we sought to determine whether MEK1 and ERK activities also stimulate IL - 2 gene transcription . Expression of constitutively active Raf - 1 or MEK1 in Jurkat T cells enhanced the stimulation of IL - 2 promoter - driven transcription stimulated by a calcium ionophore and PMA , and together with a calcium ionophore the expression of each protein was sufficient to stimulate NF - AT activity . Expression of MEK1 - interfering mutants inhibited the stimulation of IL - 2 promoter - driven transcription and blocked the ability of constitutively active Ras and Raf - 1 to costimulate NF - AT activity with a calcium ionophore . We conclude that the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway consisting of Raf - 1 , MEK1 , and ERK1 and ERK2 functions in the stimulation IL - 2 gene transcription in activated T lymphocytes . Multiple transcription factors are required for activation of human interleukin 9 gene in T cells . The genetic elements and regulatory mechanisms responsible for human interleukin 9 ( IL - 9 ) gene expression in a human T cell leukemia virus type I - transformed human T cell line , C5MJ2 , were investigated . We demonstrated that IL - 9 gene expression is controlled , at least in part , by transcriptional activation . Transient expression of the luciferase reporter gene linked to serially deleted sequences of the 5 ' - flanking region of the IL - 9 gene has revealed several positive and negative regulatory elements involved in the basal and inducible expression of the IL - 9 gene in C5MJ2 cells . An AP - 1 site at - 146 to - 140 was shown to be involved in the expression of the IL - 9 gene . A proximal region between - 46 and - 80 was identified as the minimum sequence for the basal and inducible expression of the IL - 9 gene in C5MJ2 cells . Within this region , an NF - kappaB site at - 59 to - 50 and its adjacent 20 - base pair upstream sequence were demonstrated to play a critical role for the IL - 9 promoter activity . DNA - protein binding studies indicated that NF - kappaB , c - Jun , and potentially novel proteins ( around 35 kDa ) can bind to this important sequence . Mutations at different sites within this proximal promoter region abolished the promoter activity as well as the DNA binding . Taken together , these results suggest that the cooperation of different transcription factors is essential for IL - 9 gene expression in T cells . DNA triplex formation selectively inhibits granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor gene expression in human T cells . Granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) is a hemopoietic growth factor that is expressed in activated T cells , fibroblasts , macrophages , and endothelial cells . An NF - kappaB / Rel binding site within the GM - CSF promoter , termed the kappaB element appears to be important for controlling expression in reporter gene assays in response to a number of stimuli in T cells . A 15 - base oligonucleotide , GM3 , was targeted to a purine - rich region in the GM - CSF proximal promoter , which overlaps the kappaB element . Gel mobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting demonstrated that GM3 formed a sequence - specific collinear triplex with its double - stranded DNA target . GM3 also caused selective inhibition of the human T - cell lymphotrophic virus - 1 Tax transactivator - induced luciferase activity from a reporter construct driven by the GM - CSF promoter in Jurkat T cells . Reversible differentiation of human monoblastic leukemia U937 cells by ML - 9 , an inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase . Human monoblastic leukemia U937 cells are induced to differentiate into monocytes and macrophages by various agents . We have shown that 1 - ( 5 - chloronaphthalene - 1 - sulfonyl ) - 1H - hexahydro - 1 , 4 - diazepine hydrochloride ( ML - 9 ) , an inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase , induces differentiation of monocytoid leukemia cell lines U937 and THP - 1 but not of myeloblastic leukemic ML - 1 cell or erythroleukemia K562 cells . In the present study , we further analyzed the effect of ML - 9 in comparison with that of 1 alpha , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( VD3 ) a typical inducer of monocytic differentiation . ML - 9 also induced alpha - naphthyl acetate esterase ( ANAE ) activity , another monocytic differentiation marker , more rapidly than VD3 . The maximum levels of these markers induced by ML - 9 were comparable to those induced by VD3 , but after removal of ML - 9 from the medium by washing the cells , the expressions of theses markers decreased within 4 hours and reached basal levels in 1 day , indicating that ML - 9 ' s induction of expression of differentiation - associated phenotypes was reversible . The growth inhibition of U937 cells by ML - 9 was also reversible . Similar effects were observed in another line of human monoblastic cells , THP - 1 . ML - 9 had little or no effect on the morphology of U937 cells but increased the expression of monocyte - macrophage lineage - associated surface antigen , CD14 , to some extent . Irreversible terminal differentiation induced by VD3 is associated with down regulation of the expression of c - myc and upregulation of the expression of c - fos and c - jun , but ML - 9 did not affect the expression of these oncogenes appreciably . ML - 9 - induced differentiation was also reversible when the cells were cultured with cultured with ML - 9 plus an anti - cancer drug such as 1 - beta - D - arabino - furanosylcytosine or daunomycin . it became irreversible , however , upon simultaneous treatment with dexamethasone and transforming growth factor - beta 1 ( TGF - beta 1 ) , which did not induce differentiation of U937 cells but caused growth arrest of the cells in the G0 / G1 phase of the cell cycle . A proportion of HIV - infected individuals experience episodes of localized or systemic bacterial infections caused by Gram - negative bacteria . Many of the clinical side effects of these infections are associated with the production of proinflammatory cytokines , which are induced primarily by LPS , a constituent of the bacterial cell wall of Gram - negative bacteria . Stimulation of U1 cells by LPS alone induced minimal levels of HIV expression , which was significantly enhanced by granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) . Costimulation of cells with LPS plus GM - CSF induced the production of proinflammatory cytokines , IL - 8 , IL - 1 beta and IL - 6 , but not TNF - alpha . IL - 1 receptor antagonist ( ra ) inhibited LPS enhancement of HIV expression in GM - CSF - stimulated cells , suggesting that endogenous IL - 1 was involved in LPS - mediated viral production . In this regard , anti - inflammatory cytokines inhibited LPS plus GM - CSF - stimulated HIV expression , and this effect closely correlated with inhibition of IL - 1 beta release and , in particular , with up - regulation of endogenous IL - 1ra production . Thus , the balance between an endogenously produced viral inducer ( IL - 1 beta ) and an inhibitor ( IL - 1ra ) may represent an important pathway leading to modulation of HIV expression from monocytic cells . Herpesvirus saimiri immortalized gamma delta T cell line activated by IL - 12 . Like other cytokines , IL - 12 mediates its biologic activity through high - affinity receptors expressed on responsive cells . To date , a large number of receptors for IL - 12 have been found only on PBMC following activation with PHA or IL - 2 . To gain further knowledge of the IL - 12R complex and the IL - 12 signal transduction pathway in cytotoxic T cells , we studied a number of human T cell lines that had been transformed to permanent growth with Herpesvirus saimiri , an oncogenic virus of nonhuman primates . This paper reports the expression of IL - 12R on a human gamma delta T cell line that responds to IL - 12 with enhanced cytolytic activity and increased expression of cytolytic effector molecules granzyme B and perforin . Regulation of gene expression at early stages of B - cell and T - cell differentiation . The expression of distinct sets of genes at different stages of B - lymphocyte and T - lymphocyte differentiation is controlled at the level of transcription . A number of recent studies have described interactions between transcription factors in lymphocytes that provide new insights into mechanisms regulating gene expression . Identification of a human LIM - Hox gene , hLH - 2 , aberrantly expressed in chronic myelogenous leukaemia and located on 9q33 - 34 . 1 . We describe the isolation of human LH - 2 , a putative transcription factor containing two cysteine - rich regions ( LIM domains ) and a homeobox ( Hox ) DNA - binding domain . High levels of hLH - 2 expression were observed in all cases of chronic myelogenous leukaemia ( CML ) tested , regardless of disease status . hLH - 2 was mapped to chromosome 9Q33 - 34 . 1 , in the same region as the reciprocal translocation that creates the BCR - ABL chimera of the Philadelphia chromosome ( Ph ' ) , the hallmark of CML ; hLH - 2 was retained on the derivative 9 chromosome and is therefore centromeric of c - ABL . The proximity of hLH - 2 to the breakpoint on chromosome 9 raises the possibility of cis - activation by the t ( 9 ; 22 ) ( q34 ; q11 ) translocation . In addition to finding hLH - 2 expression in all cases of CML , expression was observed in lymphoid malignancies and myeloid cell lines , but not in primary cases of acute myelogenous leukaemia . The role of hLH - 2 in the development or progression of leukaemia is not known . However , hLH - 2 may prove useful as a marker of CML for monitoring residual disease . Lymphoid cell resistance to glucocorticoids in HIV infection . In humans infected with the HIV - 1 virus there may be a disproportionate severity of signs and symptoms of illness compared to the fraction of CD4 + infected T - lymphoid cells . In part , this may be due to altered intercellular signalling systems and intracellular signal transduction . Glucocorticoids are well known for their effects on the vitality and function of lymphoid cells . However , chronically HIV - infected cells appear to be resistant to glucocorticoid - evoked cell death . Glucocorticoid receptor - ligand binding studies on patients ' cells have shown reduced affinity between the receptor binding sites and test steroids . These cells showed reduced numbers of binding sites with little alteration in apparent affinity between ligand and receptor . Such alterations may have clinical consequences , including the possibility of a relatively longer life span of infected CD4 + T - lymphocytes , as well as systemic effects of chronically elevated cortisol level . Abundant expression of erythroid transcription factor P45 NF - E2 mRNA in human peripheral granurocytes . Transcription factor NF - E2 is crucial for regulation of erythroid - specific gene expression . p45 subunit of NF - E2 contains a basic - leucine zipper domain and dimerizes with the small Maf family protein to form functional NF - E2 complex . While p45 expression was shown to be restricted to erythroid cells , megakaryocytes and mast cells in hematopoietic lineage , we found in this study that p45 mRNA is abundantly transcribed in the granulocyte fraction of human peripheral blood cells . As neutrophils occupy approximately 92 % of the cells in granulocyte fraction of human peripheral blood cells . As neutrophils occupy approximately 92 % of the cells in this fraction , the cells expressing p45 is most likely to be neutrophils . p45 mRNA is also expressed in HL - 60 promyelocytes , albeit the expression level is much lower than that of the granulocyte fraction . HL - 60 cells were found to express mafK mRNA , indicating the presence of genuine NF - E2 complex in the cells . Although p45 mRNA is transcribed from two different promoters , aNF - E2 promoter and fNF - E2 promoter , in erythroid and megakaryocytic lineage cells , p45 mRNA is transcribed only from aNF - E2 promoter . The expression of p45 megakaryocytic lineage cells , p45 mRNA is transcribed only from aNF - E2 promoter . The expression of p45 mRNA in the neutrophils declined rapidly after transfer of the cells to in vitro culture and G - CSF could not sustain the expression from the down - regulation , suggesting the E2 may also participate in the regulation of neutrophil - specific gene expression . Expression of c - fos and c - jun proteins and AP - 1 binding activity during cell cycle progression of HL60 cells and phytohemagglutinin - stimulated lymphocytes . The protein products of the c - fos ( p62c - fos ) and c - jun ( p39c - jun ) genes are members of the AP - 1 transcription factor family and are thought to play important roles in the regulation of gene expression during the cell cycle . Most studies on the expression of these proteins in relation to the cell cycle have been performed at the mRNA level , and therefore do not give direct information about the presence of the proteins during the cell cycle . We have used Western blotting to investigate the presence of these proteins during the cell cycles of two different cellular systems : a continuously growing myeloid leukemic cell line , HL60 , and normal cells stimulated into cycle , phyto - hemagglutinin ( PHA ) - stimulated normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) . The binding activity of transcription factor AP - 1 , which consists of dimers of Fos and Jun family proteins , was also studied using a gel shift assay . We found nuclear p62c - fos , p39c - jun , and AP - 1 binding activity throughout the cell cycle both in HL60 cells and in PHA - stimulated PBL , and we postulate that these proteins are required throughout the cell cycle and not transiently in the G0 to G1 transition as previous mRNA studies have indicated . We demonstrated an uncoupling of AP - 1 binding activity from p62c - fos , and p39c - jun AP - 1 activity was expressed more strongly in the G1 - and G2 / M - phase enriched samples than in the S - phase enriched samples of HL60 cells , while levels of nuclear p62c - fos and p39c - jun were constant . We also observed that cytoplasmic p62c - fos and p39c - jun were present in HL60 cells and PHA - stimulated PBL . Octamer binding factors and their coactivator can activate the murine PU . 1 ( spi - 1 ) promoter . PU . 1 ( spi - 1 ) , a member of the Ets transcription factor family , is predominantly expressed in myeloid and B cells , activates many B cell and myeloid genes , and is critical for development of both of these lineages . Our previous studies ( Chen , H . M . , Ray - Gallet , D . , Zhang , P . , Hetherington , C . J . , Gonzalez , D . A . , Zhang , D . - E . , Moreau - Gachelin , F . , and Tenen , D . G . ( 1995 ) Oncogene 11 , 1549 - 1560 ) demonstrate that the PU . 1 promoter directs cell type - specific reporter gene expression in myeloid cell lines , and that PU . 1 activates its own promoter in an autoregulatory loop . Here we show that the murine PU . 1 promoter is also specifically and highly functional in B cell lines as well . Oct - 1 and Oct - 2 can bind specifically to a site at base pair - 55 in vitro , and this site is specifically protected in B cells in vivo . We also demonstrate that two other sites contribute to promoter activity in B cells ; an Sp1 binding site adjacent to the octamer site , and the PU . 1 autoregulatory site . Finally , we show that the B cell coactivator OBF - 1 / Bob1 / OCA - B is only expressed in B cells and not in myeloid cells , and that OBF - 1 / Bob1 / OCA - B can transactivate the PU . 1 promoter in HeLa and myeloid cells . This B cell restricted coactivator may be responsible for the B cell specific expression of PU . 1 mediated by the octamer site . Inhibition of p105 processing by NF - kappaB proteins in transiently transfected cells . Regulation of the transcription factor NF - kappaB involves proteasome - mediated processing of the NF - kappaB1 p105 precursor protein , which generates the p50 subunit of NF - kappaB . The processing of p105 occurs constitutively in vivo but can be markedly enhanced by various cellular activation agents , although the underlying regulatory mechanism is not yet clear . In the present study , we demonstrate that signal - mediated induction of p105 processing in human T cells is associated with de novo synthesis of this precursor protein . Transient transfection studies performed in COS7 cells revealed that the newly synthesized p105 protein appears to be more rapidly processed compared to its accumulated form that is already associated with the processed product p50 . Interestingly , the processing rate of p105 is markedly inhibited in cells co - transfected with p50 or other NF - kappaB subunits , including RelA and c - Rel , that physically interact with p105 . These findings suggest that the processing of p105 is subject to negative regulation by the various NF - kappaB subunits . We further demonstrate that p105 undergoes degradation in lipopolysaccharide - stimulated human monocytic cells . Identification of an inducible regulator of c - myb expression during T - cell activation . Resting T cells express very low levels of c - Myb protein . During T - cell activation , c - myb expression is induced and much of the increase in expression occurs at the transcriptional level . We identified a region of the c - myb 5 ' flanking sequence that increased c - myb expression during T - cell activation . In vivo footprinting by ligation - mediated PCR was performed to correlate in vivo protein binding with functional activity . A protein footprint was visible over this region of the c - myb 5 ' flanking sequence in activated T cells but not in unactivated T cells . An electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) with nuclear extract from activated T cells and an oligonucleotide of this binding site demonstrated a new protein - DNA complex , referred to as CMAT for c - myb in activated T cells ; this complex was not present in unactivated T cells . Because the binding site showed some sequence similarity with the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) binding site , we compared the kinetics of induction of the two binding complexes and the molecular masses of the two proteins . Studies of the kinetics of induction showed that the NFAT EMSA binding complex appeared earlier than the CMAT complex . The NFAT protein migrated more slowly in a sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel than the CMAT protein did . In addition , an antibody against NFAT did not cross - react with the CMAT protein . The appearance of the CMAT binding complex was inhibited by both cyclosporin A and rapamycin . The CMAT protein appears to be a novel inducible protein involved in the regulation of c - myb expression during T - cell activation . CNI - 1493 inhibits monocyte / macrophage tumor necrosis factor by suppression of translation efficiency . Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) mediates a wide variety of disease states including septic shock , acute and chronic inflammation , and cachexia . Recently , a multivalent guanylhydrazone ( CNI - 1493 ) developed as an inhibitor of macrophage activation was shown to suppress TNF production and protect against tissue inflammation and endotoxin lethality [ Bianchi , M . , Ulrich , P . , Bloom , O . , Meistrell , M . , Zimmerman , G . A . , Schmidtmayerova , H . , Bukrinsky , M . , Donnelley , T . , Bucala , R . , Sherry , B . , Manogue , K . R . , Tortolani , A . J . , Cerami , A . & Tracey , K . J . ( 1995 ) Mol . Med . 1 , 254 - 266 , and Bianchi , M . , Bloom , O . , Raabe , T . , Cohen , P . S . , Chesney , J . , Sherry , B . , Schmidtmayerova , H . , Zhang , X . , Bukrinsky , M . , Ulrich , P . , Cerami , A . & Tracey , J . ( 1996 ) J . Exp . Med . , in press ] . We have now elucidated the mechanism by which CNI - 1493 inhibits macrophage TNF synthesis and show here that it acts through suppression of TNF translation efficiency . CNI - 1493 blocked neither the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - induced increases in the expression of TNF mRNA nor the translocation of nuclear factor NF - kappa B to the nucleus in macrophages activated by 15 min of LPS stimulation , indicating that CNI - 1493 does not interfere with early NF - kappa B - mediated transcriptional regulation of TNF . Further evidence for the translational suppression of TNF is given by experiments using chloram - phenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) constructs containing elements of the TNF gene that are involved in TNF translational regulation . Both the 5 ' and 3 ' untranslated regions of the TNF gene were required to elicit maximal translational suppression by CNI - 1493 . Identification of the molecular target through which CNI - 1493 inhibits TNF translation should provide insight into the regulation of macrophage activation and mechanisms of inflammation . Soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors inhibit phorbol myristate acetate and cytokine - induced HIV - 1 expression chronically infected U1 cells . Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) binding protein - 1 ( r - h TBP - 1 ) and recombinant human soluble dimeric TNF receptor ( rhu TNFR : Fc ) were used to determine the relative contributions of TNF to phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) and cytokine - induced human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) replication in chronically infected cell lines . Treatment of HIV - 1 - infected promonocytic U1 cells with r - h - TBP - 1 or rhu TNFR : Fc reduced PMA - induced HIV - 1 p24 antigen production in a concentration - dependent manner , with a maximal inhibition of approximately 90 % . Maximal inhibition of p24 antigen production in T - lymphocytic ACH - 2 cells was 47 % with r - hTBP - 1 and 42 % with rhu TNFR : Fc . U1 cells stimulated with 10 ( - 7 ) M PMA released approximately 1 ng / ml endogenous TBP - 1 with an initial peak observed at 1 h and a second peak at 24 h after PMA stimulation . Both r - hTBP - 1 and rhu TNFR : Fc blocked PMA induction of nuclear factor ( NK ) - kappa B DNA - binding activity in U1 cells in association with decreases in HIV - 1 replication . We conclude that soluble TNF receptors can inhibit stimuli - induced HIV - 1 expression and NK - kappa B DNA - binding activity in chronically infected U1 cells . The human T - cell leukemia virus - encoded tax protein is a potent activator of many viral and cellular genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II . We find that both chromatin and cell extracts derived from human T - cell leukemia virus type 1 - infected human T lymphocytes support higher levels of 5S rRNA and tRNA gene transcription than chromatin or extracts from uninfected T lymphocytes . Both limiting - component transcription assays and DNA binding assays identified the class III gene transcription factor TFIIIB as the principle target of Tax activity . Surprisingly , we find that Tax increases the effective concentration of active TFIIIB molecules . These data suggest that Tax stimulates RNA polymerase III - dependent gene expression by accelerating the rate and / or extent of transcription initiation complex assembly . 1 alpha , 25 - Dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( VD ) is a potent inducer of monocytic differentiation of both normal and leukemic cells . Its effects are mediated by its nuclear receptor ( VDR ) . In the present study using specific antibodies , we analyzed the expression of the RXR alpha protein in blood mononuclear cells from acute myeloid patients ( AML ) ( 10 cases ) and from myelomonocytic cell lines arrested at different stages of differentiation . We observed that the RXR alpha expression increased during myelomonocytic differentiation , since the highest levels were found in AML samples and in myelomonocytic cell lines having the highest amounts of monocytic precursors . We also demonstrated that fresh leukemic cells , whatever their stage of differentiation , as well as myelomonocytic cell lines , respond to VD by an increase in RXR alpha levels . This response suggests the involvement of RXR alpha in monocytic differentiation upon VD treatment . Expression of p13MTCP1 is restricted to mature T - cell proliferations with t ( X ; 14 ) translocations . T - cell prolymphocytic leukemia ( T - PLL ) , a rare form of mature T - cell leukemias , and ataxia telangiectasia clonal proliferation , a related condition occurring in patients suffering from ataxia telangiectasia , have been associated to translocations involving the 14q32 . 1 or Xq28 regions , where are located the TCL1 and MTCP1 putative oncogenes , respectively . The MTCP1 gene is involved in the t ( X ; 14 ) ( q28 ; q11 ) translocation associated with these T - cell proliferations . Alternative splicing generates type A and B transcripts that potentially encode two entirely distinct proteins ; type A transcripts code for a small mitochondrial protein , p8MTCP1 , and type B transcripts , containing an additional open reading frame , may code for 107 amino - acid protein , p13MTCP1 . The recently cloned TCL1 gene , also involved in translocations and inversions associated with T - cell proliferations , codes for a 14 - kD protein that displays significant homology with p13MTCP1 . We also investigated the MTCP1 locus configuration by Southern blot analysis . Our data support the hypothesis that p13MTCP1 and p14TCL1 form a new protein family that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of T - PLL and related conditions . Preassociation of STAT1 with STAT2 and STAT3 in separate signalling complexes prior to cytokine stimulation . Ligand - induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the STATs promotes their homodimer and heterodimer formation and subsequent nuclear translocation . We demonstrate here that STAT protein heterocomplexes exist prior to cytokine treatment . When unstimulated HeLa cells are ruptured in hypotonic buffer without salt or detergent , immunoadsorption of either STAT1 or STAT2 from the resulting cytosol yields coimmunoadsorption of the other STAT protein . Similarly , STAT1 - STAT3 heterocomplexes are coimmunoadsorbed from hypotonic cytosol . STAT1 and STAT2 or STAT1 and STAT3 translated in reticulocyte lysate spontaneously form heterocomplexes when the translation lysates are mixed at 0 degrees C . Our data suggest that interferon - alpha / beta - induced tyrosine phosphorylation increases the stability of a preexisting , latent , STAT1 - STAT2 signaling complex . Newly translated STAT1 binds in equilibrium fashion to STAT2 and STAT3 , but we show that STAT2 and STAT3 exist in separate heterocomplexes with STAT1 , consistent with a model in which STAT1 contains a common binding site for other STAT proteins . Interferon - gamma modulates the lipopolysaccharide - induced expression of AP - 1 and NF - kappa B at the mRNA and protein level in human monocytes . Interferon - gamma ( IFN - gamma ) modulates the expression of several cytokines by human monocytes at the transcriptional level . In view of these findings , we analyzed the effects of IFN - gamma on the expression of different transcription factors in activated human monocytes . Priming of human monocytes with IFN - gamma resulted in the down regulation of c - fos and c - jun mRNA in response to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) compared to the effects of LPS alone . Not only was this effect observed at the mRNA level , but activator protein - 1 ( AP - 1 ) DNA binding capacity was affected as well , A strong reduction was observed in the LPS - induced DNA - binding activity of AP - 1 in the presence of IFN - gamma . LPS - stimulated monocytes showed an increased expression of p105 mRNA , the precursor of the p50 subunit of the transcription factor nuclear factor - kappa B ( NF - kappa B ) , while no effect was noticed on the expression of p65 mRNA . In contrast , IFN - gamma priming did not affect the expression of p105 transcripts but enhanced the expression of p65 mRNA ( two - fold ) . Priming with IFN - gamma followed by LPS stimulation resulted in a further increase in the expression of p65 mRNA . This was due to an increase in the half - life of p65 mRNA ( 75 vs 150 minutes ) . Stimulation with LPS or IFN - gamma resulted in the expression of p50 and p65 subunits , while the combination of IFN - gamma plus LPS caused a further increase in the expression of NF - kappa B . With Western blotting , it was shown that nuclear extracts from monocytes contained p50 and p65 protein in response to LPS and IFN - gamma stimulation . HIV - 1 tat induces the expression of a new hematopoietic cell - specific transcription factor and downregulates MIP - 1 alpha gene expression in activated T - cells . MIP - 1 alpha is a secreted chemokine which can inhibit hematopoietic stem cells and modulate inflammatory responses . It is also an inhibitor of HIV replication in CD8 + T - cells . Monocytes and transformed B - cells normally express MNP - 1 strongly and MNP - 2 weakly , while T - cells strongly express only MNP - 2 . Recently , we reported that HIV - 1 tat downregulates MIP - 1 alpha expression in Jurkat T - cells . Expression of neither HTLV - 1 tax in Jurkat T - cells nor EBV in B - cells had any effect on MNP - 1 or MNP - 2 expression , showing that the effect is specific for HIV - 1 tat . We propose that HIV - 1 tat may inhibit MIP - 1 alpha expression by inducing MNP - 1 expression in T - cells , probably by either competing with MNP - 2 for binding to the MIP - 1 alpha promoter or by sequestering it into inactive forms . Interleukin - 4 ( IL - 4 ) and interleukin - 12 ( IL - 12 ) control the differentiation of T - helper cells . Here we summarize studies which investigate the mechanism by which these cytokines selectively reprogramme gene expression in T - lymphocytes . Cytokine stimulation leads to the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues within the intracellular domain of the corresponding cytokine receptor . These phosphotyrosines serve as docking sites for latent , cytoplasmic transcription factors known as signal transducers and activators of transcription ( Stat ) proteins . Receptor / Stat interaction is mediated by the src homology 2 ( SH2 ) domain of the corresponding Stat protein . Although Stat binding to the intracellular domain of the cytokine receptor strongly depends on the phosphotyrosine residue , the recruitment of a specific Stat protein is dictated by amino acid residues C - terminal to the phosphotyrosine . Role of EGR1 in regulation of stimulus - dependent CD44 transcription in B lymphocytes . The immediate - early gene egr - 1 encodes a transcription factor ( EGR1 ) that links B - cell antigen receptor ( BCR ) signals to downstream activation events through the regulation of previously unidentified target genes . BCR - induced increases in CD44 mRNA expression and transcription levels are shown to occur in EGR1 - expressing but not in nonexpressing subclones of the B - cell line WEHI - 231 . Kinetics of egr - 1 transcription and the appearance of nuclear EGR1 protein precede CD44 induction and occur within 30 min after stimulation in the EGR1 - expressing subclone . A single EGR1 binding motif is demonstrated at bp - 301 of the human CD44 promoter . Cotransfection of a CD44 promoter - chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct with an egr - 1 expression vector resulted in a 6 . 5 - to 8 . 5 - fold induction of transcriptional activity relative to an empty expression vector . The relevance of these molecular events to BCR signal transduction and antigen - stimulated B - cell - mediated immune responses is discussed . Involvement of intracellular Ca2 + in oxidant - induced NF - kappa B activation . In human Jurkat T cells and its subclone Wurzburg cells oxidant challenge elevated [ Ca2 + ] i by mobilizing Ca2 + from intracellular stores . In Jurkat cells this effect was rapid and transient , but in Wurzburg cells the response was slow and sustained . H2O2 - induced NF - kappaB activation in Wurzburg cells was not influenced by the presence of extracellular EGTA but was totally inhibited in cells that were loaded with esterified EGTA . NF - kappaB regulatory effect of alpha - lipoate and N - acetylcysteine appeared to be , at least in part , due to their ability to stabilize elevation of [ Ca2 + ] i following oxidant challenge . Results of this study indicate that a sustained elevated [ Ca2 + ] i is a significant factor in oxidant - induced NF - kappaB activation . Transactivation of the interleukin - 1alpha promoter by human T - cell leukemia virus type I and type II Tax proteins . Human T - cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV - I ) - infected T - cell lines constitutively produce high levels of interleukin - 1alpha ( IL - 1alpha ) . To analyze the mechanisms that lead to the expression of IL - 1alpha in HTLV - I - infected cell lines , we studied regulatory regions of the human IL - 1alpha promoter involved in activation of the IL - 1alpha gene . IL - 1alpha promoter constructs drive transcription of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) reporter gene in HTLV - I - positive MT - 2 cells , which constitutively produce IL - 1alpha . In a cotransfection assay , the Tax protein of both HTLV - I and HTLV - II specifically activated transcription from the IL - 1alpha promoter in an uninfected Jurkat cell line . We found that two IL - 1alpha kappaB - like sites ( positions - 1 , 065 to - 1 , 056 and + 646 to + 655 ) specifically formed a complex with NF - kappaB - containing nuclear extract from MT - 2 cells and that NF - kappaB bound with higher affinity to the 3 ' NF - kappaB binding site than to the 5 ' NF - kappaB site . Moreover , deletion of either 5 ' or 3 ' NF - kappaB sites reduced IL - 1alpha promoter activity in MT - 2 cells and transactivation of the IL - 1alpha promoter by exogenous NF - kappaB and Tax in Jurkat cells . These data suggest a general role for Tax induction of IL - 1alpha gene transcription by the NF - kappaB pathway . Expression of IL - 1alpha by HTLV - I productively infected cells may be important in the hypercalcemia , osteolytic bone lesions , neutrophilia , elevation of C - reactive protein , and fever frequently seen in patients with HTLV - I - induced adult T - cell leukemia / lymphoma . The myeloid - cell - specific c - fes promoter is regulated by Sp1 , PU . 1 , and a novel transcription factor . The protein product of the c - fps / fes ( c - fes ) proto - oncogene has been implicated in the normal development of myeloid cells ( macrophages and neutrophils ) . Transient - transfection experiments demonstrated that plasmids containing 446 bp of c - fes 5 ' - flanking sequences linked to a luciferase reporter gene were active exclusively in myeloid cells . No other DNA element within the 13 - kb human c - fes locus contained positive cis - acting elements , with the exception of a weakly active region within the 3 ' - flanking sequences . DNase I footprinting assays revealed four distinct sites that bind myeloid nuclear proteins ( - 408 to - 386 , - 293 to - 254 , - 76 to - 65 , and - 34 to + 3 ) . Plasmids containing 151 bp of 5 ' - flanking sequences confer myeloid - cell - specific gene expression . This unidentified factor binds immediately 3 ' of the PU . 1 / Elf - 1 sites and appears to be myeloid cell specific . Mutation of the PU . 1 / Elf - 1 site or the 3 ' site ( FP4 - 3 ' ) within the context of the c - fes promoter resulted in substantially reduced activity in transient transfections . Furthermore , transient - cotransfection assay demonstrated that PU . 1 ( and not Elf - 1 ) can transactivate the c - fes promoter in nonmyeloid cell lines . We conclude that the human c - fes gene contains a strong myeloid - cell - specific promoter that is regulated by Sp1 , PU . 1 , and a novel transcription factor . IL - 10 inhibits nuclear factor - kappa B / Rel nuclear activity in CD3 - stimulated human peripheral T lymphocytes . The inhibition is exerted specifically on the NF - kappa B / Rel activation induced by mAb OKT3 , and not that produced by PMA . IL - 10 inhibitory activity is exerted on T lymphocytes and is mediated by monocytes . Indeed , monocytes pretreated with IL - 10 are able so inhibit NF - kappa B nuclear activity in purified T lymphocytes stimulated with OKT3 . Soluble factors do not appear to be involved in the mechanism of inhibition . On the other hand , the up - regulation of CD80 Ag , found on monocytes obtained from PBMC incubated with OKT3 , is not detected after addition of IL - 10 , and the anti - CD28 mAb CLB - CD28 / 1 restores the NF - kappa B / Rel nuclear activity in IL - 10 - inhibited lymphocytes . Therefore , the NF - kappa B / Rel inhibition might be ascribed to a lack of cooperation between accessory cells and T lymphocytes , resulting from down - regulation of a costimulatory molecule , such as CD80 , produced by IL - 10 on activated monocytes . Since inappropriate activation of kappa B - driven genes has a physiopathologic role in a number of diseases , such as HIV infection , our findings support the possibility of using this cytokine to suppress an undesirable activation of these transcription factors . Expression of A - myb , but not c - myb and B - myb , is restricted to Burkitt ' s lymphoma , sIg + B - acute lymphoblastic leukemia , and a subset of chronic lymphocytic leukemias . The A - myb gene encodes a transcription factor that is related both functionally and structurally to the v - myb oncogene . Following our observations that A - myb is expressed in a restricted subset of normal mature human B lymphocytes , with the phenotype CD38 + , CD39 - , slgM - , we have now investigated the pattern of A - myb expression in neoplastic B cells representating the whole spectrum of B - cell differentiation and compared it to that of c - myb and B - myb . Protein expression paralleled that of the RNA . We have also investigated A - myb expression in 49 fresh cases of B leukemias . Among 24 ALL , 6 were of the null and 11 of the common type and all these were negative for A - myb expression ; on the other hand , all 7 B - ALL cases ( slg + ) , as well as one fresh BL case with bone marrow infiltration , expressed A - myb . A - myb was undetectable in 4 prolymphocytic leukemias ( PLL ) but was strongly expressed in 5 / 20 ( 25 % ) of chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) samples . In the latter A - myb did not correlate with phenotype or clinical stage . Finally , we have studied the progression of one case of CLL into Richter ' s syndrome and have found that the Richter ' s cells expressed about 25 - fold less A - myb RNA than the CLL cells from the same patient . The pattern of c - myb and B - myb was clearly distinct from that of A - myb . This expression may in part reflect expression of A - myb by the normal germinal center B cells that are the normal counterpart of these transformed B cells . The data presented strongly support a role for this transcription factor in B - cell differentiation and perhaps in B - cell transformation in some neoplasias . Granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor stimulates JAK2 signaling pathway and rapidly activates p93fes , STAT1 p91 , and STAT3 p92 in polymorphonuclear leukocytes . Granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) , supports proliferation , differentiation , and functional activation of hemopoietic cells by its interaction with a heterodimeric receptor . Although GM - CSF receptor is devoid of tyrosine kinase enzymatic activity , GM - CSF - induced peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( PMN ) functional activation is mediated by the phosphorylation of a large number of intracellular signaling molecules . We have previously shown that JAK2 becomes tyrosine - phosphorylated in response to GM - CSF in PMN . In the present study we demonstrate that also the signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT ) family members STAT1 p91 and STAT3 p92 and the product of the c - fps / fes protooncogene become tyrosine - phosphorylated upon GM - CSF stimulation and physically associated with both GM - CSF receptor beta common subunit and JAK2 . Moreover GM - CSF was able to induce JAK2 and p93fes catalytic activity . We also demonstrate that the association of the GM - CSF receptor beta common subunit with JAK2 is ligand - dependent . Finally we demonstrate that GM - CSF induces a DNA - binding complex that contains both p91 and p92 . These results identify a new signal transduction pathway activated by GM - CSF and provide a mechanism for rapid activation of gene expression in GM - CSF - stimulated PMN . Epstein - Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 ( EBNA2 ) - oestrogen receptor fusion proteins complement the EBNA2 - deficient Epstein - Barr virus strain P3HR1 in transformation of primary B cells but suppress growth of human B cell lymphoma lines . To develop a transformation system with a conditional Epstein - Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 ( EBNA2 ) gene , we fused the hormone binding domain of the oestrogen receptor to the N or C terminus of EBNA2 . In promoter transactivation as well as primary B cell transformation assays these chimeric EBNA2 proteins are able to substitute for wild - type EBNA2 in the presence of oestrogen . Unexpectedly , expression of the same EBNA2 - oestrogen receptor fusion protein in established human B cell lymphoma lines resulted in growth retardation or growth arrest upon the addition of oestrogen . By titrating the oestrogen concentration in these stably transfected cells , the growth retarding and the transactivating function of the chimeric proteins could not be dissociated . We propose that growth inhibition of established B cell lymphoma lines is a novel function of EBNA2 which has not been detected in the absence of an inducible system . Tissue - specific activity of the gammac chain gene promoter depends upon an Ets binding site and is regulated by GA - binding protein . The gammac chain is a subunit of multiple cytokine receptors ( interleukin ( IL ) - 2 , IL - 4 , IL - 7 , IL - 9 , and IL - 15 ) , the expression of which is restricted to hematopoietic lineages . A defect in gammac leads to the X - linked severe combined immunodeficiency characterized by a block in T cell differentiation . In order to better characterize the human gammac promoter and define the minimal tissue - specific promoter region , progressive 5 ' - deletion constructs of a segment extending 1053 base pairs upstream of the major transcription start site were generated and tested for promoter activity in various hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell types . The - 1053 / + 34 construct allowed promoter activity only in cells of hematopoietic origin , and tissue specificity was conserved in all other constructs tested . The region downstream of - 90 appeared critical for basal promoter activity . It contains two potential Ets binding sites conserved in the murine gammac promoter gene , one of which was found essential for functional promoter activity as determined by mutational analysis . The functional Ets binding site was found to bind Ets family proteins , principally GA - binding protein and Elf - 1 and could be transactivated by GABPalpha and - beta synergistically . Although GABP expression is not restricted to the hematopoietic lineage , its interaction with other specific factors may contribute to the tissue - specific expression of the gammac gene . One of the manifestations of human HIV - 1 and nonhuman primate SIV infection that lead to disease is reasoned to be secondary to generalized T - cell dysfunction . To address this issue , we sought to utilize the nonhuman primate model to study intracellular signaling events in cells from disease - susceptible rhesus macaques and disease - resistant sooty mangabeys . Antibodies to Stat6 detected a unique band in macaque cell lysates . This band is markedly decreased human cell lysates and never seen in mangabey cell lysates . Detection of various other intracellular signaling proteins is also described . Genetic characterization of transactivation of the human T - cell leukemia virus type 1 promoter : Binding of Tax to Tax - responsive element 1 is mediated by the cyclic AMP - responsive members of the CREB / ATF family of transcription factors . To achieve a better understanding of the mechanism of transactivation by Tax of human T - cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax - responsive element 1 ( TRE - 1 ) , we developed a genetic approach with Saccharomyces cerevisiae . We constructed a yeast reporter strain containing the lacZ gene under the control of the CYC1 promoter associated with three copies of TRE - 1 . Expression of either the cyclic AMP response element - binding protein ( CREB ) or CREB fused to the GAL4 activation domain ( GAD ) in this strain did not modify the expression of the reporter gene . Tax alone was also inactive . However , expression of the reporter gene was induced by coexpression of Tax and CREB . This effect was stronger with the GAD - CREB fusion protein . Analysis of different CREB mutants with this genetic system indicated that the C - terminal 92 amino acid residues , which include the basic domain and the leucine zipper , are necessary and sufficient to mediate transactivation by Tax . To identify cellular proteins binding to TRE - 1 in a Tax - dependent manner , this strain was also used to screen a library of human cDNAs fused to GAD . Of five positive clones isolated from 0 . 75 x 10 ( 6 ) yeast colonies , four were members of the CREB / activating transcription factor ( ATF ) family : CREB , two isoforms of the cyclic AMP - responsive element modulator ( CREM ) , and ATF - 1 . Interestingly , these three proteins can be phosphorylated by protein kinase A and thus form a particular subgroup within the CREB / ATF family . The fifth clone identified in this screening corresponded to the Ku autoantigen p70 subunit . When fused to GAD , the C - terminal region of Ku was able to activate transcription via TRE - 1 but this activation was not dependent on Tax . A mammalian histone deacetylase related to the yeast transcriptional regulator Rpd3p [ see comments ] A trapoxin affinity matrix was used to isolate two nuclear proteins that copurified with histone deacetylase activity . Both proteins were identified by peptide microsequencing , and a complementary DNA encoding the histone deacetylase catalytic subunit ( HD1 ) was cloned from a human Jurkat T cell library . As the predicted protein is very similar to the yeast transcriptional regulator Rpd3p , these results support a role for histone deacetylase as a key regulator of eukaryotic transcription . Coexpression of the interleukin - 13 and interleukin - 4 genes correlates with their physical linkage in the cytokine gene cluster on human chromosome 5q23 - 31 . Interleukin - 13 ( IL - 13 ) and IL - 4 are cytokines produced by T cells that are encoded by the q23 - 31 region of human chromosome 5 . To investigate the regulation of IL - 13 gene expression by T cells , we isolated and sequenced the human IL - 13 gene , analyzed its 5 ' - flanking region for potential transcriptional activation elements , and examined its expression in nontransformed T - lineage cell populations . The human IL - 13 gene was located 12 . 5 - kb upstream of the IL - 4 gene and 2 - kb downstream of a CpG island . The IL - 13 gene 5 ' flank region included a segment with sequence homology to P elements of the IL - 4 promoter involved in transcriptional activation in T cells . Mutation of the IL - 13 P element site significantly reduced IL - 13 promoter activity in response to T - cell activation . Oligonucleotides containing the IL - 13 or IL - 4 P element sites specifically bound the transcriptional activator protein , nuclear factor - activated T cells , preformed ( NF - ATp ) , when incubated with nuclear protein extracts from activated T cells . Similar to IL - 4 , IL - 13 mRNA expression was highest in T - cell populations enriched for cells that had previously been primed in vivo or in vitro , indicating that priming increases the expression of the IL - 13 and IL - 4 genes in a coordinate manner . Because the primed T cells contain higher levels of nuclear NF - ATp , capable of binding to P elements of the IL - 4 and IL - 13 promoters , than do freshly - isolated T cells , the NF - AT - binding P elements are attractive candidates to mediate the coordinate expression of these two cytokine genes . Inhibition of alpha interferon but not gamma interferon signal transduction by phorbol esters is mediated by a tyrosine phosphatase . Previous studies have indicated that the expression of viral oncoproteins , cell transformation , or phorbol ester treatment of cells can inhibit alpha / beta interferon ( IFN - alpha / beta ) - induced gene expression . In this report , we demonstrated that phorbol ester treatment of human peripheral blood monocytes dramatically inhibits activation of IFN - alpha / B - stimulated early response genes but by a mechanism which does not involve abrogation of the ISRE binding of ISGF3gamma . IFNalpha - stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 and the alpha subunit of the IFN - alpha receptor were unaffected by phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) . Moreover , PMA caused the dephosphorylation of Tyk2 but not of Jak1 , which was activated by IFN . These observations suggest that PMA exerts its inhibitory effects by activation of a tyrosine phosphatase which selectively regulates Tyk2 but not Jak1 activity . Transcriptional regulation of the interleukin - 2 gene in normal human peripheral blood T cells . Convergence of costimulatory signals and differences from transformed T cells . To study transcriptional regulation in normal human T cells , we have optimized conditions for transient transfection . As assessed with mutagenized promoters , the most important IL - 2 cis - regulatory elements in normal T cells are the proximal AP - 1 site and the NF - kappaB site . Both primary activation , with phytohemagglutinin or antibodies to CD3 , and costimulation , provided by pairs of CD2 antibodies or B7 - positive ( B cells ) or B7 - negative ( endothelial ) accessory cells , are mediated through the same cis - elements . Interestingly , the nuclear factor of activated T cell sites are much less important in normal T cells than in Jurkat T cells . We conclude that IL - 2 transcriptional regulation differs in tumor cell lines compared with normal T cells and that different costimulatory signals converge on the same cis - elements in the IL - 2 promoter . The present study , using highly enriched human CD34 + as well as Lin - murine bone marrow progenitor cells , demonstrates a potent inhibitory effect of 9 - cis - RA on burst - forming unit - erythroid ( BFU - E ) colony formation regardless of the cytokine stimulating growth . Specifically , 9 - cis - RA potently inhibited the growth of BFU - E response to erythropoietin ( Epo ) ( 100 % ) , stem cell factor ( SCF ) + Epo ( 92 % ) , IL - 3 + Epo ( 97 % ) , IL - 4 + Epo ( 88 % ) , and IL - 9 + Epo ( 100 % ) . Using synthetic ligands to retinoic acid receptors ( RARs ) and retinoid X receptors ( RXRs ) that selectively bind and activate RAR - RXR or RXR - RXR dimers , respectively , we dissected the involvement of the two retinoid response pathways in the regulation of normal myeloid and erythroid progenitor cell growth . Transactivation studies showed that both the RAR ( Ro 13 - 7410 ) and RXR ( Ro 25 - 6603 and Ro 25 - 7386 ) ligands were highly selective at 100 nmol / L . In addition , we demonstrate a unique involvement of the RXR - RXR pathway in mediating growth inhibition of erythroid but not myeloid progenitor cells . AM580 , a stable benzoic derivative of retinoic acid , has powerful and selective cyto - differentiating effects on acute promyelocytic leukemia cells . All - trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) is successfully used in the cyto - differentiating treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) . Paradoxically , APL cells express PML - RAR , an aberrant form of the retinoic acid receptor type alpha ( RAR alpha ) derived from the leukemia - specific t ( 15 ; 17 ) chromosomal translocation . We show here that AM580 , a stable retinobenzoic derivative originally synthesized as a RAR alpha agonist , is a powerful inducer of granulocytic maturation in NB4 , an APL - derived cell line , and in freshly isolated APL blasts . However , in the presence of PML - RAR , the synthetic retinoid is a much better transactivator of retinoic acid - responsive element - containing promoters than the natural retinoid , whereas , in the presence of RAR alpha , AM580 and ATRA have similar activity . This may explain the strong cyto - differentiating potential of AM580 in PML - RAR - containing leukemic cells . Most New World primate ( NWP ) genera evolved to require high circulating levels of steroid hormones and vitamin D . We hypothesized that an intracellular vitamin D binding protein ( IDBP ) , present in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of NWP cells , or another protein ( s ) may cause or contribute to the steroid hormone - resistant state in NWP by disruption of the receptor dimerization process and / or by interference of receptor complex binding to the consensus response elements present in the enhancer regions of steroid - responsive genes . We employed electromobility shift assay ( EMSA ) to screen for the presence of proteins capable of binding to the vitamin D response element ( VDRE ) . The extracts were compared for their ability to retard the migration of radiolabeled double stranded oligomers representative of the VDREs of the human osteocalcin and the mouse osteopontin gene promoters . A specific , retarded band containing VDR - RXR was identified when wild type cell but not when vitamin D - resistant cell nuclear extract was used in the binding reaction with either probe . BCL - 6 expression during B - cell activation . Translocations involving the BCL - 6 gene are common in the diffuse large cell subtype of non - Hodgkin ' s lymphoma . Invariably , the BCL - 6 coding region is intact , but its 5 ' untranslated region is replaced with sequences from the translocation partner . The present study shows that BCL - 6 expression is regulated in lymphocytes during mitogenic stimulation . Resting B and T lymphocytes contain high levels of BCL - 6 mRNA . Stimulation of mouse B cells with anti - IgM or IgD antibodies , bacterial lipopolysaccharide , phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate plus ionomycin , or CD40 ligand led to a five - fold to 35 - fold decrease in BCL - 6 mRNA levels . Similar downregulation of BCL - 6 mRNA was seen in human B cells stimulated with Staphylococcus aureus plus interleukin - 2 or anti - IgM antibodies and in human T lymphocytes stimulated with phytohemagglutinin . BCL - 6 mRNA levels began to decrease 8 to 16 hours after stimulation , before cells entered S phase . Although polyclonal activation of B cells in vitro invariably decreased BCL - 6 MRNA expression , activated B cells from human germinal centers expressed BCL - 6 mRNA at levels comparable to the levels in resting B cells . Despite these similar mRNA levels , BCL - 6 protein expression was threefold to 34 - fold higher in germinal center B cells than in resting B cells , suggesting that BCL - 6 protein levels are controlled by translational or posttranslational mechanisms . These observations suggest that the germinal center reaction provides unique activation signals to B cells that allow for continued , high - level BCL - 6 expression . DNA - binding phosphoproteins induced after T cell activation : effects of cyclosporin A . To define novel proteins involved in the early transcriptional response during the activation of human T lymphocytes , we used a high - resolution , two - dimensional gel electrophoresis system to identify nuclear , deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) binding proteins exhibiting rapid changes in phosphorylation following cell stimulation . We identified 18 nuclear proteins whose phosphorylation level changed more than 5 - fold upon activation . Of these , 11 were found to possess DNA - binding properties . The 11 phosphoproteins with DNA - binding activity , along with 4 others , were analyzed further . Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed several sets of proteins with different phosphorylated residues Kinetic analysis of the phosphorylation of the selected proteins was performed and revealed a complex group of transient and sustained responses to cell activation . We suggest that these phosphoproteins may be directly involved in regulating the transcriptional response to cellular activation by external stimuli . Inactivation of IkappaBbeta by the tax protein of human T - cell leukemia virus type 1 : a potential mechanism for constitutive induction of NF - kappaB . In resting T lymphocytes , the transcription factor NF - kappaB is sequestered in the cytoplasm via interactions with members of the I kappa B family of inhibitors , including IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta . During normal T - cell activation , IkappaBalpha is rapidly phosphorylated , ubiquitinated , and degraded by the 26S proteasome , thus permitting the release of functional NF - kappaB . In contrast to its transient pattern of nuclear induction during an immune response , NF - kappaB is constitutively activated in cells expressing the Tax transforming protein of human T - cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV - 1 ) . Recent studies indicate that HTLV - 1 Tax targets IkappaBalpha to the ubiquitin - proteasome pathway . However , it remains unclear how this viral protein induces a persistent rather than transient NF - kappaB response . In this report , we provide evidence that in addition to acting on IkappaBalpha , Tax stimulates the turnover Of IkappaBbeta via a related targeting mechanism . Despite the\""
